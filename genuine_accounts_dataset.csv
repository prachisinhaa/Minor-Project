MissFebz,My 13 yr old sons Christmas list 2024 Priceless! ,"
1 I would very much enjoy some gray converse shoes they are known to be comfortable and I enjoy how they look a ideal amount and my current shoes are beaten up and in some places falling apart thank you

2 I would like some merchandise of some of my favourite artists some of witch are stated below
Melanie Martinez 
Marina (or marina and the diamonds)
Lady gaga(if of course she has merchandise that are of my interests)
And perhaps Billie eillish 
I would prefer certain kinds of merchandise such as hoodies specifically ones that are baggy and posters for decorating my room it is quite barren maybe shirts baggy T-shirts and darker colours so black or dark blue the darker of the colours are much preferred for the clothing but posters I don’t really care the colour thank you

3 a Tiffany lamp I do love a Tiffany lamp I find the colours interesting the stained glass and just a desktop one I’m not even sure if they make them too big anyway but jsut to be sure a desktop size please as interesting as possible i do not care were you get it in fact the vintage the better but not broken please thank you

4 for my next gift it would be jeans specifically baggy jeans and even more specific is that they look like Colton’s quote “queer jeans”so baggy jeans and make them a little darker then his so in conclusion I want darker coloured baggy jeans as a gift for Christmas thank you


5 I would like some sweatpants plain coloured so white sweatpants this one is very small that’s it really a very simple one just plain white sweatpants thank you

6 a other small one but I would like some plain sweaters darker colours almost the same as the merchandise one but not merch on it just plain baggy and plain darker colours so black or maybe white just keep it plain and not bright thank you

7 a body pillow so I have to explain? It’s a body pillow who doesn’t want a body pillow they are extremely comfortable and huggable cause I don’t like hugging people but I still like hugging thank you

8 headphones specifically headphones and not earbuds I don’t care about what brand really just good quality I would rather good to bad I don’t really ,care about colour so black or white or gray I don’t really care thank you


9  this is a honourable mention that I don’t really expect to get in the slightest do to past conversations but a phone I would like to have a phone in-fact it is something that I would very much like to have for myself I do not care if it’s a new one and I don’t expect that you would ever get me one of the newer models of iPhone so iPhone 13 maybe cause it is not new and I’m not sure but I am sure that it would be less then the newer ones but I get that I will probably (most definitely)not get a phone for Christmas or my birthday or maybe I won’t get one until much after I turn 13 thank you


10 and I would like a apron I don’t really care what it has on it or if it’s plain but I am tired of having to change clothes after baking because I get flour on myself so just a apron simple or whatever you want with this on thank you


11 and for 11 we have ✨star pimple patches✨ because I ran out of my pimple patches and I like the star ones they are nice and one of the only bright things I like so ya and I’m going to make this a double maybe some more skin care  cause I’m kinda running out of my stuff thank you

12 so if you didn’t know I have body acne and it kinda sucks like a lot so before summer when I have to have people look at my body I would like that to clear up and I know it’s hormones and in a few years when this part of puberty stops it will probably leave but I still don’t like it so I want to kinds of products one Salicylic acid products can help and exfoliating products so both of thoes  would be most helpful thank you

13 this is one I really really really really want so I really want a once upon a December day music box so if you didn’t know once upon a December is a song from the old Disney movie Anastasia and I really like music boxes I like mechanical ones some can see all the gears moving I don’t even care if I can’t put anything in it I just want a Anastasia once upon a December music box so so much thank you


I think for know this is fine and I will stop here cause if you gave me long enough I could get a pretty big list so I will stop at 13 cause I am turning 13 in January and I don’t want to make you feel pressured because there is a lot of things on here these are all just things I want you don’t really need to get them all especially the phone one and I don’t get my hopes up on all the things I want cause I know I probably won’t get all the things I want and that’s just life you don’t always get what you want🤷‍♂️ and I might want to add things cause I feel like there is something I really want that I forgot on here so ya Austens Christmas list for 2024 I guess",2024-12-23 19:28:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1hkvbzx/my_13_yr_old_sons_christmas_list_2024_priceless/,funny,False

His mother asks him, ""Ben, have you done your chores?""
He says No"". Then his mother says ""Well you can't have breakfast until you've done your chores"". So, upset, he goes outside.

First, he goes to feed the chicken, and he kicks a chicken.
Then, he goes to feed the pigs, and he kicks a pig.
Lastly, he goes to feed the cows and he kicks a cow.

He goes back inside the house and his mother gives him a bowl of cereal without any milk. Ben is asking: mom, where's the milk, where are the eggs, where's the bacon? 

His mother replies: I saw you kick the chicken, no eggs for a week, I also saw you kick the cow, no milk for a week, I saw you kicking the pig, no bacon for a week. 

At that point Ben's dad walks into the house and he kicks the cat, and little Ben says: mom, are you going to tell him or should I?",2024-12-20 10:43:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1hih6vl/little_ben/,funny,False

B1ackMag1ck,The Great Oreo War,"Hey reddit. I recently took part in a massive feud concerning what I consider to be a crime against human decency. My coworkers and I were discussing Oreos and how we eat them, and one of my friends (who already has a littany of bizarre food quirks) commented that she scrapes the cream out and THROWS IT AWAY.

This shut the room down momentarily.

""What do you mean you throw it away?"" I said.

This woman buys packs of Oreos, SCRAPES the cream off and tosses it, claiming that she likes the cookie part but the cream is too sweet. To my horror, two more people claim they do the same thing. This to me is psychotic behavior. Unhinged. Why would anyone buy a product just to throw out half of it?!

I told them they sell the cookie part separately, and they said no, they WANT the slight taste of cream on the cookie. I was ready to burn the room down at this point.

Let's buy a pizza and scrape off the cheese! Let's buy a burger and just eat the buns!

Someone please back me up on this. ",2024-12-18 14:57:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1hh3c33/the_great_oreo_war/,funny,False

Tuckerboy790,FBI agent from Castro Valley under allegations of cyberstalking,"A federal grand jury indicted a former FBI agent from Castro Valley under allegations of cyberstalking, witness tampering, and obstruction of a criminal investigation by bribery, the United States Department of Justice announced Wednesday.

Paul Raymond Flood, 54, is accused of cyberstalking a first-year law student who contacted him about pursuing a career with the FBI in the future. Flood made “unwelcome” romantic advances to the victim after she first contacted him in October 2018 and even talked her into a “sham marriage,” the DOJ said.

  
Flood had a diamond ring delivered to the victim just weeks after they were introduced. He also used 79 different phone numbers to call and text the victim over the span of a year, per the DOJ.

  
Flood allegedly told the victim that he was surveilling her and her family and pressured a family member to have her unblock him. The victim did not report Flood for fear of retaliation until June 2019. 

The FBI suspended Flood after the complaint and began to investigate his behavior. After this, Flood threatened suicide and successfully bribed the victim into not participating in the investigation, according to the DOJ. 

Flood talked her into a sham marriage, even buying her a $17,000 engagement ring. However, the woman did not follow through with the marriage.

  
The ex-FBI agent now faces a litany of charges including cyberstalking, witness tampering by harassment and obstruction of a criminal investigation by bribery.

toyotaman1178,My experience with oklahoma city police department tonight. ,"Was driving up the road when someone up ahead switched on their light bar, and highbeams. Looked to be some asshole in a truck, or SUV. Flashed mine back assuming he thought mine were on. His remained on as he passed the vehicle later mentioned in the video that had its highbeams on, and no tail lights. I flipped mine back on since he wasn't getting the message. He turned his spot light on, and aimed it at my eyes while I was driving up the road absolutely blinding me. He proceeded to waive it around. At this point I realized it was a police vehicle as he slammed his brakes, and turned screeching the tires. At this point I was very disorientated while driving my car up a dark road at night. After blinding me he proceeded to take off past me, and towards the road ahead at a high rate of speed. I flashed mine one more time, and he slammed his brakes to get behind me, and pull me over. He proceeded to approach my vehicle in a hostile manner taking, an angry tone telling me he could write me a ticket for flashing my lights. I had already called 911 at this point since his actions appeared to be that of someone who stole a police car rather than someone entrusted with one. I requested a supervisor during the altercation to which he suddenly decided it wasn't worth doing all of that, and trying to sweet talk me out of it. The supervisor showed up, and wasn't much better. I'm getting that dash cam, and body cam. ",2024-12-13 05:56:19,https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/hV5QUJ8Rpvzg,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,False

wildgoose2000,On Patrol Live tv show,"One of the police departments they follow is Hazen Arkansas.  If you look on google Hazen is off the highway but apparently they have stretched their town limits to include 10 miles of Interstate 40.  It shows the boundary of the town unnaturally stretch to make a piggy bank for the police department.  They resemble a violent gang shaking down motorists with intimidation.  Every stop the chief, who loves the spotlight, aggressively interrogates, digging for any violation.  He is a real highwayman, an example of who you never want to encounter on the highway.  

I haven't seen them do any enforcement in the town yet.  They only patrol the interstate, that's where the big money is after all.

The reason I looked up the town was the militaristic gusto these asses use and I wanted to be sure to avoid this little paradise.   They have top of the line equipment and vehicles.  They look like they are patrolling occupied Baghdad, not a quiet stretch of America.

IMO If you want to watch everything that is wrong with American law enforcement this is a good place to start.  The show is on Reelz tv channel.

Driz51,Even in a situation where I think a cop’s actions are all justified they still show such a disturbing lack of humanity. Curious to hear if others feels the same ,"So here you’ve got a mom who is obviously panicking because she’s speeding to make sure the movers don’t drive off from her new house and now she’s also getting a speeding ticket. In the heat of the moment she makes a really stupid move and gets out the car to see if the movers are right there. She tells the officer give me a second, but of course no officer is going to do that and she gets placed in cuffs. No issue there she made a stupid move and that’s what happens.

But afterwards when you’ve got the lady under control, you hear her explanation for her actions and see all the evidence around you….just let it go. There’s a little girl watching her mother get attacked from her perspective. You don’t need to traumatize this kid any further. I agree with everything the mom says when she’s speaking to the other officer. Give her the speeding ticket, even give her another ticket for her stupid behavior, but you don’t have to go through with the arrest. He even refuses to let her call her husband when she’s asking and the other officer has to handle that. 

This guy acts like he can’t even fathom why she would tell him I don’t want to get all the way in this car and leave my daughter all alone. All the comments on the video are noting but praising the cop, but again even though I don’t think his initial actions are wrong at all I still think you can have a fucking heart and take everything into consideration.

Steampunkedcrypto,Record number of immunity cases are ongoing.,"Lately, I have been watching the 3 judge panel hearings that happen almost weekly, on qualified immunity cases. It is amazing the amount of spin that the officers lawyers try to present to the judges.  The panel only decides ""if"" the cases can proceed to a jury trial, based on the evidence that was already accepted and ruled on in a prior trial of the defendants that were harmed by the police.
They always let the defendant ( cop attorney) go first and cite prior case laws of what actions were deemed reasonable by any officer to do what they did. Most involve shooting, excessive force, etc.. with rights violations bringing up the rear.

The ones where the cops are allowed a wide birth of making a mistake, are the ones that many officers get away with the most egregious crimes. Example, ( they thought it was a gun, or ""resistance "" to their unlawful orders.

llogrande,"God, The Devil, and Trump","Here’s a joke: 
 
Trump passes away on his hundredth birthday. Now, Trump stands before God and the Devil. 

First, the Devil asks him “Mr Trump, I certainly admired 99% of your tweets, your contribution to humanity, and your net worth; however, I’d like to know what was your finest achievement, sir”. Trump looks fondly at the Devil and answered the question honestly. “Well, I’d have to say it was the lying. You know, it came very, very easy to me, in fact, I’d have to say, I’m the best damn liar that walked the earth, sir.”

Next, God asks “Mr. Trump, for all the wonderful work you have accomplished, and, sir, you’ve done a lot of fantastical things, what would you say is the one thing that you didn’t get to accomplish while you were on earth?” Trump looks directly at God, then his eyes turn slightly away as Trump answers the question honestly. “God Damn, that’s a tough question. You know I’m damn near perfect but I had to fight for everything, even those things that were, umm, not quite honest; but, I’d have to say…” 

Suddenly, Trump disappears.

The Devil asks God “What just happened?”

God replies: “Well, I stopped listening when he said ‘God Damn’ so I did.”",2024-12-13 01:56:56,https://i.redd.it/kykhgqquvi6e1.jpeg,PoliticalHumor,True

thrwawy4advise,Etiquette when ending a friendship after finding out they're racist?,"Hi all. I am looking for advice regarding a conversation I had with a (now former) friend of mine a few days ago. We are both white, and I met her earlier this year after moving to a more rural/red area to be closer to work. We don't hang out super often but she does live close by so I see her around, and I got to know her family a bit as well because they own the local bar.

She made a comment when we were hanging out the other day that was blatantly racist, and after I called it out she said ""yeah I'm a little racist"" as if it was just a quirk about her or something (and of course followed it up with the classic ""but I'd never say it to someone's face or say the n word"" as if that excuses anything). I had no idea she felt that way before now, and she seemed like a reasonable person any time we talked about social issues.

So obviously I have no interest in continuing to be friends after this and I won't be going to that bar anymore either. I planned to just break our Snapchat streak and stop talking with her and maybe only say something about it if she asks to hang out again, but my boyfriend thinks I should reach out first to tell her so she's aware of what she did wrong and that this is a direct consequence. I want to handle this the right way and (if possible) get her to reconsider her attitude toward POC rather than having her just get annoyed and dismiss me as a snowflake or something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2024-12-16 20:23:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1hfsjlh/etiquette_when_ending_a_friendship_after_finding/,racism,False

Wasabinoots,Helping my partner (40 M) to have a discussion on racism and his personal upbringing.,"Hi, I’m 30 M south east asian living with my partner. We are a gay couple who lived together for quite sometime. 

Context:

Before we moved in together I already learned that my partner who is white had a particularly tough time growing up as a gay person in rural Belgian village, so he knows how it feels personally to be marginalized based on who you are, informally denied access to opportunities , physically and mentally abused, excluded from his own people who are predominantly also white. Luckily his family accepts him which is not a common thing if you are born in the 80s so he grew up only with his close family and few friends until his early 20s. So in short, he knows how it is to be discriminated and marginalized in a different context.

The present day:

I recently observed that 

1. He particularly doesn’t enjoy when people are joking about white people like ”these white people 🤦🏽‍♂️” kind of jokes because he doesn’t want to be associated with them as he doesn’t relate to their racist behavior. But he can’t because he is born white skinned, so he has to share the burden of shame that he didn’t do.

2. He questioned why a lot of PoC get away with derogating white people in a stereotypical way? Instead of addressing the bad behavior to individuals?

3. He feels like he had been denied opinion on racism because he is white. When this happened it triggered his memory from when he grew up as marginalized gay men in the 80s and 90s that he cannot participate in the society because of his sexual orientation, and he know how it feels to be casted aside of simply being a person.

The question 🙋🏽‍♂️ 

I love him so much, he is a kind and loving person. But how should I engage in this conversation with him about how he feels? I don’t want to invalidate his own experiences on being discriminated against and marginalized. I know it is a different subject but I do also think sexual orientation discrimination and racism shares similar characteristics.

Thank you 🧡",2024-12-01 08:06:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1h3yjrb/helping_my_partner_40_m_to_have_a_discussion_on/,racism,False
Necessary-Tackle-591,Good article on micro-aggressions for an out-of-touch boomer? ,"My white boomer MIL has instituted a tradition of taking us to dinner once a month, and she has done a micro-aggression to a POC service worker every time the opportunity has arisen. My partner, thier sibling, and I have all spoken to her about it each time, and her position each time is that what she's done is right and good and not offending anyone, because the person has ""smiled at her."" She believes herself to be an anti-racist. We have made all the arguments, but she doesn't process information well verbally, and doesn't think we could know more than her. She really responds to reading articles. I believe my best hope at getting through to her is to send her articles, but everything I've found assumes a level of understanding or facility in extrapolation that she doesn't possess. 

Do any of you out there have any written resources to share that explain microagressions, specifically linguistic microagressions, in a simple but also detailed and way?

Puzzleheaded_Bad_464,"Hi guys, I wanted to get some of other peoples opinion on this because for some reason no one has noticed what I noticed. I think that I might be tripping but I don’t feel like I am…","Okay so I 18(f) am a medical student in my first year. Started in September so I’m really new to this stuff. Anyway we have something called a gp group were you get put in a group of 9 ppl and you will do to the gp/family practice and will learn from GP (general practitioner). Today we presented a poster on vaping which highlighted the impact on a person but also the societal, cultural influence and so forth. Btw there were about 9 topics so we each did one and these are just a few examples. 

Okay so I ended up doing societal influence and it was all good. Please note that I’m the only black person in the group and the rest are white-ish. Another Irish girl (f 23) had to write about cultural differences and pulled a figure that BAME ( black, Asian and other ethnic minorities) were less likely to vape then white young adults. Now the doctor would ask each of us a question about what we wrote and so she asked the girl why she thought Blacks vaped less. The girl answered that she wasn’t sure. The the GP said this word for word…. I think that it is because of poverty, blacks can’t afford vapes and therefore vape less. 

Now personally I was really shocked by this and looked around if anyone noticed but no one did. The gp then went on to say that another reason is that they can’t speak English well and therefore won’t be peer pressured as much as white kids. 

To me this just sounded like she is saying that most  black people and poc’s are in poverty and can’t speak English. I tried to explain it to my south East Asian friend but she says I’m reaching. However I genuinely don’t think I’m over reacting and I genuinely felt a bit appalled and hurt by this statement. Especially the fact that those three sentences came right after each other must mean is related rightttt?!!

Just to clarify this is what happened 
Girl: BAME people are less likely to vape then white people
GP: why do you think is that 
Girl: I’m not sure 
GP: it’s probably because o poverty and they can’t afford vapes 
GP: also they don’t succumb to peer pressure as much because they can’t speak English 

Like a more valid reason would have beeen that vaping just is not in their culture or stricter parents or something. Like I think vaping is a pretty westernised thing as I haven’t seen anyone in my country in Africa vape. Even so the statement she made is wild to me.

Also about the English thing that has to be racist no? Like it’s not like people can’t learn English after a few years. You can’t assume that most BAME ppl can’t speak English.

Anyway let me know what you think.",2024-11-27 00:27:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1h0rddk/hi_guys_i_wanted_to_get_some_of_other_peoples/,racism,False

hereforwhatimherefor,Little known Lord of the Rings Racist White Supremacism,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilboes

Did you know:

Lord of the Rings is a series written by a white Oxford professor from 33-55 during the height of Nazi and also KKK power.

About a grand white wizard uniting the “white races” of Europe (middle earth is literally ancient Europe in the book)

To fight off hordes of asiatic and dark skinned monsters named orc (hell devil) in a reference to what racist christians tried to “justify slavery with” saying dark skin was the “mark of cain”

Whose a supreme council (with white wizards on it) called “the white council” that the author used synonymously with “the wise council”

And the authors (jr Tolkein) only known drawing of orcs is black humanoids being slaughtered by a white bear and white soldiers

And the name of the most famous character in the series (Bilbo) also is the name of the shackles that held enslaved Black people on slave ships together one leg to the others, a  passage of the Atlantic that 15-20% of the enslaved people died painful horrible deaths.

And he said he modelled their facial features off what he called “the least lovely mongol types.”

The hordes of Hell Devil (orc) monsters of tolkeins works invading europes strongholds were east and south.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_A_Translation_and_Commentary

Tolkein took the term Orc from the 10th century Beowulf poem, in which they are the “cursed race of Cain” (of the Jewish / Christian Bible story of Cain and able) which was used extensively during Black Slavery, and is famously in the Book of Mormon.

He had done a translation and commentary of it prior to doing lotr.

Tolkein said he chose the word for “phonetic” (the way the word orc literally sounds) reasons.  

Tolkein never said anything about the fact his book was about grand white wizards on white / wise councils in Europe uniting white races to fight hell devil Black and Asiatic demon monsters from east and south and the main characters name was the word for shackles that held slaves together, not at any point during his life when millions of white kids were being indoctrinated by this “white = good and human and black = monstrous and evil.  He of course knew this indoctrination was happening - that was the point - and he was tragically common of his era (Princeton freshman class voted Hitler greatest man alive in 1939, Churchill ran on “keep Britain white after the war).  Martin Luther King JR marched on him and those like him, he lost, and now the freedom those Civil Rights Heroes and Heroines secured for us combined with the internet has finally broadly exposed Tolkein. 

People say he was “anti colonial” and “anti empire” and that is true.  It’s also a common position of white racists, who view contact with dark skinned people like being in contact with a contagious virus.  Many white racists also can be found to have statements that seem to speak out against cruelty in racist institutions, and Tolkein has a few, but it is important to keep in mind white racists also view non whites like animals and such comments can be understood as them saying “there’s no reason to be cruel to the monkeys in the jungle” or “if we capture a monkey in the jungle to work on our farm, we do not want to cause the monkey anymore harm than necessary for us to get sugar in our tea or make rum.”",2024-11-26 04:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1h0360h/little_known_lord_of_the_rings_racist_white/,racism,False

Blu3Bandana,“I have a black friend” argument,"BACKGROUND INFO (not very important but kind of a rant and also adds some context):
Hi, so my mom growing up was exposed to a lot of racism. Her dad is incredibly racist and has said the n word a ton of times among MANY other things. Thankfully, my mom isn’t nearly as racist, when she grew up she went to a school that was very mixed and wasn’t overwhelming white like my dad’s was. From her childhood to high school she was best friends with a girl who’s black that lived near her, even though her dad was SUPER against it (ex: he wouldn’t allow my mom to give her their food, wouldn’t allow her to sleep over, asked her several times why she would want to hang out/be around her, etc). However, my mom has still said outrageously racist things, including telling us to only give one piece of candy to colored kids on Halloween because they’re from apartments and not from our neighborhood. Even my dad (who has his own racism issues) was like weirded out when she said this. Something that especially bothers me however is how she always uses the “my best friend growing up was black” excuse, like, my dad probably has had some close friends of color but even he doesn’t say that.

QUESTION: How do I dumb down/summarize that the black friend argument isn’t valid? I love my mom but she isn’t the brightest bulb, if anyone has any arguments/simplified ways of explaining it they might want to share that would help a lot

Jealous-Source2945,How do I stop being so angry?,"I am so tired of being angry. Imagine having a lover. This lover spends years abusing you mentally, physically and emotionally. From the start of your relationship he has separated you from everything you have ever known. This lover tells you that you will amount to nothing because of the way you look. Any opportunities given to you is because you are appealing to the eye and everyone wants a piece of you to feel better about themselves. You couldn’t get a job because he’s worked with his friends to make sure you aren’t hired even though you have the same qualifications. He always say “I hit you last week that means nothing now, when will you let it go?” You work yourself 3x harder than his mistresses just to get the opportunity to hold his hand. Everything around your house are memories of when you were beaten, lied to and gaslit. You can’t go anywhere because he’s in control of your finances and you have no one else. Even today he tells you that “you have to stop playing victim for something that happened so long ago.”  

Sounds familiar? 

My entire childhood I had no concept of race as a black woman. I learned it through experience. I see it in the way I choose two or more races on my job applications. I see it when I pass by plantation houses in my state. I see it when they look up from the paper and see that my skin doesn’t match my name. I see my town littered with remnants of housing that was meant for oppression. I am a constant reminder of the history that came before me. I have always had to work 3x harder than my pale counterpart and had never complained. But when you tell me to my face that racism is gone, my forever simmering anger comes to a boil.

Wrong_Letterhead1985,Suggestions for fiction books or movies focused on DEI related topics?,"Hi all, I'm looking to help organize a book club or movie showing at my organization to think through diversity, equity, and inclusion topics -- could be focused on racism, or other intersectional topics (any of the other -isms, really). We're wondering if there are any movie or book recommendations for something that is fiction, possibly not too heavy given current morale, and that avoids major triggers like severe violence (for example, I'd thought about /The Hate U Give/ but know that could be really triggering). Ideally something that is more focused on community resilience and hope. It doesn't have to have a good ending necessarily. Just looking for something that could generate discussion and promote unity/hope given the current societal context.

I know I'm asking for a bit of a unicorn, so I appreciate any suggestions the hive mind might have! I also wasn't sure if there are other reddit threads where I should ask this. All suggestions welcome. Thank you so much!

She then admitted to me that she used to say the n-word as a kid, explaining that she grew up in an environment where that word was taught to be “cool”, even her black friends at the time would “give her the pass”, so she didn’t know how hurtful and offensive the word is until she left that environment. I believed her when she said this (she was around 12 at the time). However, she started tearing up and explaining about how there’s a video of her saying it out there and how embarrassing it is. She kept saying profusely how she isn’t racist and went on about how could anyone even be racist. She then asked me if I hate her. I definitely don’t hate her and I think she’s a genuinely kind and amazing person. I just found it uncomfortable to console her about it. She didn’t even want me to (I tried to give her a hug but she refused).

I have nobody to talk to this about/ people who care that much about my situation. Christine Buechler was my English teacher I recall she would always make little remarks about my ethnicity, mind you Im indigenous and lots of other indigenous kids go to that school. It's mostly white and natives that go to that school because it's 15 minutes from the reservation, but I remember the day she called me an Indian. We were talking about cultural appropriation and then we got to the part where she started talking about indigenous people. She laughed and said ""Back in my day I remember dressing up as cowboys and Indians"" Then she turned to me said ""Mckayla how would you like it if I dressed up as cowboys and Indians again? This woman knows that I'm a serious advocate for my people and I love being indigenous, I have a strong sense of social justice therefore she specifically targeted me. Im a shy good kid so I have never ever done anything for her to not like me besides my race, I was also in her art class and I was making an art piece that fit the criteria but I wanted to write something in Ojibwe my native language. So I did write in my language as soon as I handed it in she says that I shouldn't have wrote in Ojibwe because ""it takes away from my art"" mind you everyone else wrote something in English... Obviously got a bad grade on that, and there is so much more she has said but I wanna get into another teacher Tichenoff this guys is a racist and likes looking at teen girls. He was my geography teacher and business teacher, the second day he separated the coloured people in my class on the left side was natives and a few other people. On the right side was the white kids, he knew what he was doing. So in class we had to do a presentation and there were these twin girls in my class and there beautiful but not to sound weird or anything but they had a big bottom and this in gonna be important for in the story. They get up to do their presentation and I noticed him staring at the one girls behind and there standing to where there in front of him and he's behind them. He's not taking his eyes off them so I tell my friend beside me like ""do you see this guy?"" then he puts his hand in his front pocket and starts rubbing his crotch area through his pants. He could've been itchy but I swear he wouldn't be itchy for THAT long, The same thing happened again with the same girls but this time he was listening to a voice recording they made for a project, he starts rubbing himself again through his pocket. Like I said before there's way more to it but those were the main things, they put me through hell. I suffer with depression and other stuff and I almost ended my life because of how bad it was, call me sensitive or whatever because I am and I know there's gonna be racist people everywhere I go but school should be a safe place especially If its your first year.

Connect_Camel6657,liberal racism ,"hi! i’m white and so is the friend in this story. (lmk if this isn’t the right place for me!)

i know this isn’t a big deal, but i wanted to get it off my chest because it was pissing me off. 

today my friend (trans liberal from california) said that he “headcannons” his cat as a “poc woman”. this was after listing a bunch of personality traits that he also assigned the cat (specifically that she would sit outside on a porch chain smoking). without thinking, i went “oh that’s not…” and he got really upset and asked the one woman of color in our group what she thought.
 i love this friend, but this is a pattern that i’ve observed a few times now - he also has an oc who was killed by the police, and prefaces almost every sentence with “this isn’t supposed to be *racist/classist/etc* but…”
also today i learned that he doesn’t know what apartheid was, and i feel like if you think you know enough about race to headcannon your cat as a woman of color, you should at least know some basic history.

anyway. that’s my rant. ",2024-10-30 03:13:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1gfd859/liberal_racism/,racism,False

I lost my receipt but it was an unopened item. The guy asked for my ID I gave it to him and basically started interrogating me. Like what my name and last name was even though clearly shows on my driver license.

 He goes as far and says to me that ""I don't look like that would be my name, that I  thought you'd have a more spanish name"" and after that exchange he approves my return and I leave the store with my gift card but I'm fumming in the car ride back home.

Locked_Artist,Rude man during liberation event.,"For context this weekend it was a liberation day event in the city I live in. 

I myself like to help people if I think they need help. In this case there was this beautiful Muslim lady and I had already began walking faster to ask her if I could help her with her groceries.

Before I could ask there was a white dude that loudly said ""your race should be shot"".

We both stopped because of shock. The dude just walked off. I quickly asked her if I could help carry things and continoud to talk to her and assure her that her faith is beautiful and some people are just assholes.

Once I said goodbye and simontainiously came home I full on cried because that man made that comment to a absolutely lovely human being that was just going around her day. I've experienced racism in my country, but this was next level.

Existenceisafarce,Understanding,"Watching Anne with an E and now they’re bringing up the fact that, back in the day, many thought Native Americans were savage (everybody act surprised! :0). And this has sent me into a bit of a spiral into how I legit don’t understand the underlying belief behind racism. You know how you can logically understand something but not emotionally? That’s me rn. 

Like, logically, I understand that racism is like “oh, this group of ppl are subhumans and must conform to etc…” BUT I JUST DONT GET IT U KNOW??? My brain just keeps going back to “but they’re literally people!” And I know I don’t HAVE to get it, I don’t want to walk in these people’s shoes. I just want to understand how they walk in their shoes so I can move on. My whole life I’ve usually been able to vaguely understand where people are coming from, but trying to understand racists just confounds me the way no other perspective has.

It’s not like I haven’t had this spiral before. I only started having these when I moved to mainland USA. I had been surrounded by nothing but minorities until I moved here and met racist people. And I’m just SO CONFUSED. I need this explained to me in the deepest possible level you can go. In fact, if any former racists see this, I need you to tell me everything about your prior thinking. I just…I can’t get over it. I’ve gone to the goddamn LIBRARY to find a book on the psychology of racism. No luck tho, the librarian looked at me like I was crazy. IM NOT CRAZY UR CRAZY!!!

ArcaneSignet01,My friends continue to hang out with people who were Racist towards me,"I am a Black man (26 M), and I’ve been close friends with two guys, one white (28 M) and one Middle Eastern (28 M), since I was 16. These two are part of the main group I usually hang out with. Four months ago, we played D&D together along with two other guys, former school friends whom I hadn’t seen in almost five years. I had drifted from these two due to life changes, and honestly, I remembered them being a bit weird when it came to their views on minorities and queer people, but I brushed it off back then.

So, I was surprised when they joined us for D&D after all this time. Right off the bat, things went south: one of them used the n-word behind a door as soon as he heard I was also there. I felt shock and confusion, so much so that I didn’t even stand up for myself. Then, when they walked in, the other guy made tasteless, racist comments about me being a criminal and suggested I should play a rogue because I’m Black.

They didn’t just target me—they made offensive remarks about my Middle Eastern friend too. He didn’t seem to take it personally, but I felt completely thrown off. I left quietly afterward, not knowing how to process everything. Later, I talked to the friend who had invited them, hoping he’d understand how hurtful it had been. He acknowledged that it was upsetting but casually added that I should have stood up for myself, as if it was on me to handle it alone.

After that experience, I couldn’t bring myself to join another D&D session with them. But what stings the most is that my two friends continued playing with those guys, carrying on as though nothing had happened.

Maybe I should’ve confronted those two guys, but it’s painful to realize that my friends—the people I considered like brothers—still choose to spend time with them after what I went through. I feel betrayed, yet I’m torn because we’ve been close for a decade. Cutting ties feels drastic, especially as I find it hard to make new friends.

What would you do in my position? Would it be fair to step back from these friendships?

deeplyrapidsending,bullied by a security guard because of my skin color ,"I need to share my experience because I'm fed up. I'm a French man of mixed African descent, and living in certain neighborhoods in France has made me feel like a second-class citizen. I work long hours-waking up at 6 a.m. to take the train from Rouen to Paris, only to get home around 7 p.m. Most days, I'm too drained to do much else.
Today, after another exhausting commute, I stopped by my local supermarket to grab some food. I've shopped there many times, but today was different. The security guard, seeing me—a brown guy with a work bag-decided to approach me and insisted I leave my bag at the front desk. This has never happened to me before.
I've gone in with that same bag countless times without issue.
I was too tired to argue; after four hours of traveling each day, just wanted to grab something to eat and go home. I complied, but I could feel the guard's eyes on me as l moved through the store, like I was being watched for any reason to be called out.
As I headed to the cash register, I encountered an older woman—let's call her Karen-who had left a pack of water bottles to ""reserve"" her spot in line. In my rush, I accidentally skipped over them. That's when she decided to unleash her anger on me. Instead of politely pointing it out, she started shouting insults, treating me like I was the problem.
The way she looked at me made it clear-she didn't see a tired man just trying to get home; she saw a threat.
The security guard rushed over, reinforcing that perception. Instead of diffusing the situation, he asked me to move to another register, effectively treating me like the troublemaker.
This isn't an isolated incident. I've walked into stores in the city center of Rouen with that same bag, and nobody said a word. But here, in this neighborhood, it feels different—more hostile. It's as if my existence makes them uncomfortable.
I'm exhausted-not just from work and commuting, but from dealing with this constant barrage of prejudice. I don't want to cause trouble or make a scene, but I'm so tired of being treated like a criminal simply for existing.
I'm done with that supermarket. France prides itself on being a nation of equality, but in places like this, it fe like those values are reserved for a select few. It's disheartening to realize that, in some neighborhoods, I'll always be seen as a second-class citizen.

Particular_Paper_603,Need help for solving racism problem ,"Hi guys I just joined this page but I am dead ass serious about this rn.
I’m korean and I moved to canada bc when I was 11. And in middle school, i remember encountering racism at school multiple times. I talked to the counselor like two to three times but she never took any kind of action even though she said she would. And on the last time I talked to her after encountering racism, she said I am so sensitive hahaha. And there were so many racism I faced but most importantly, I never felt safe from those in school. And this is very important to me because after facing racism and the counselor not taking any action, even when I dont face any racism I would always feel insecured and intimidated in public, even when Im just walking outside. And this just changed my whole life because after having low esteem I felt like i cannot do anything, i felt like i should hide my korean identity, i would feel insecured if my korean accent will stand out when im talking, i would feel anxious that all my actuons even just walking would look weird to ppl. I was so stupid….. and this made me to lose my personality, what I like, and my seven years of precious teenage life. I thought about my elementary school life back in korea everyday since i moved here, until now.

And now I really want to change and I want to get those racism problems i encountered straight. So I was thinking of sending an email to the middle school i went to, describe racisms i encountered but I dont know what exactly I should say to them to make myself at least somewhat satisfied from what I encountered and had to go through. I want them to feel very very sorry and i want the counselor to lose her job forever but I dont even know if she is still working there haha. And I want the school to educate students about racism regularly and actually confirm to me what they taught. And I wish I could get any help or support from it . Idk.. my life is just ruined after i moved to canada and idk if any change could make me feel better haha…

But if there are any ideas you have, also if you guys know of any organization that provides support on racism that would be so helpful.

Brief-Aerie-3228,Advice on handling nation wide racism while seeking a job as a tiny minority,"Brace yourselves, a depressing long life story...

I was born in Saudi, I'm Lebanese, father got the citizenship by lottery in the 80s, as a result I'm a Saudi citizen, which is quite rare for non-Saudi origin person to have one.

Due to the never ending conflicts in the Middle East, Lebanese have earned a bad reputation in Saudi, and due to tribalism and religious extremism in the past 30 years plus the fact that Lebanese are the only Arabs to be very diverse in religions I have faced many challenges growing up in KSA.  The past decade is significantly better and very progressive.. I don't think that most people living outside KSA are aware of the major changes in a very short period, the media isn't covering it enough.

I changed schools five times, the schools I was in were religious Islamic schools, no math/science/english etc.  
There were no alternatives other than very expensive elite ones according to my parents which I'm not sure if they're telling the truth, you will read why later.

I had to sit in an isolation room during recess from the constant harassment and physical assaults by many students and teachers, thankfully the administrators were very understanding, but the students and teachers thought I was Shi'a Muslim which are vehemently hated at the time due to war and local media.  
I'm originally a Druze which my parents always threatened me not to say the word to anyone as it's non Abrahamic, and it turned out later that it's actually better to say that instead of letting them guess the worst one, a sect.

For those that don't know the significance, you must be a Muslim to be a Saudi, generally. But it has to be the right sect, else it's a lot worse than having another religion. I wasn't even aware of what ""Druze"" even means until I left Saudi, I always thought we were non practicing Muslims or whatever and Druze meant a neighborhood.

It started from praying in the school mosque in grade two which I was forced to do as with everyone, I made a triangle shape with my hands on the carpet before I laid my head since the carpet was nasty, they thought Shi'a prayed like this which is not true, I was harassed and hit by 2 teachers, got expelled and one of them got fired. The next school two much older students tried to throw me from a 3rd floor window while chanting ""mushrek"" in the first month, so I had to leave immediately, the next had a stealing issue I couldn't leave my bag without it being thrown from a window into a gated residential area, as such I had to stay in classroom during recess and couldn't go to restrooms, the next one didn't have teachers attending the school most of the days, so I slept in classroom like everyone and so on.

The first school area I was in was extremely religious, they would knock down on everyone's house/apartment for Fajr prayer and harass you if you do not attend the local mosque, none of this is relevant now thankfully. We also used to pass a public beheading display on our way home from school, it wasn't that graphic from my memory as a child as it was confusing, no blood or whatsoever, I think they would be beheaded privately then put on display with everything covered. Bodies high and covered and heads on the floor. I'm mentioning this to give you an idea of how I felt like, always on the edge, most Saudis would voice their discomfort in the media until it was banned, but that is a different story. The rest of the city never had this form of extremism though so I got unlucky, I won't mention where for privacy and safety.

Fast forward, grade eight, my parents realized that my education is too poor (or the lack of) to attend any college or university, so my father had to stay in Saudi for his government job, and I was sent to Lebanon with my mother to complete high school, it was very difficult to catch up, especially with the French system education, I eventually passed with many private tutoring, studying math from scratch with only few years left, got called retarded by everyone behind back and patronized but thankfully zero harassment or confrontation, they treated me way too nice, only teachers believed the education gap, I managed to make a friend or talk to someone my age for the first time at \~15 years old.

The struggle to get there is my guess for why my parents won't help me which I will discuss later, they don't think I would be able to pass college, but that's just my guess.  
My English was self-taught during primary and middle school from watching movies and my mothers help.

During my childhood in Saudi, I could never leave the apartment, no relatives or friends to talk to, no video games or internet allowed, I would play pretend to shoot a movie and act or re-enact scenes, during the 3-month summer vacation every year I stayed home watching the same movie on MBC channel being played almost everyday for a week for almost a decade. It was a huge culture shock going to my country of origin, Lebanon, and just talking with people or leave the house. It took me around five years to be comfortable and not constantly alert and anxious.  
Following the economic crash in Lebanon, I had to go back to Saudi, but before I delve into that: in Lebanon I lived with my parents after high school confused of what to do after school other than looking for a job, there were no financial aid at the time and two affordable colleges shutdown many of their disciplines due to the crisis making it harder to apply, I thought I would use the money to study abroad or work anything.

My parents two story villa was on a mountain in the middle of nowhere, three hours drive from the city, potholes every 200 meters, and the wages are extremely low, I wouldn't be able to afford transportation without help, there is no public transport, you need a car, and fuel can take up the entire salary. Almost all of my classmates have left the country at this point including my distant siblings, they are all helped by their rather struggling parents. My parents and grandparents were also helped by their parents, but mine decided not to. My entire family tree from both sides are immigrants or migrants for most of their lives, yet they remind me to be grateful that I live with them despite not complaining...

My mother decided to stay and wait for the travel ban to lift, and I couldn't leave her alone there by going back to Saudi, it took around five years before we went back, it wouldn't have mattered anyway.  
I managed to work remotely as a freelance software developer (no degree) successfully during that time, but I couldn't get paid, I used my fathers wiring account and other means which weren't practical and tax issues, banks didn't allow opening new accounts in Lebanon at the time due to recession, the next idea was to go back to Saudi and open an account there and go back to my mother since as I mentioned before she's living there alone and need helps considering my father is still working in Saudi. There was a travel ban a year pre-COVID so that made it impossible, travelling Saudi to Lebanon was banned not from, the ban has been active for five years as of this writing.

My mother didn't want to go back since she lived in KSA for 30 years without talking to anyone and that led her to be chronically depressed and hop between many medications, we lived in Saudi apartments, almost impossible to integrate, our apartment wasn't gender split to invite any Saudi (two living rooms male & female), and women weren't allowed to leave without a man back then let alone drive. My father was too lazy to drive us around after work or in the weekends, he would arrive home and watch TV till sleep, while not doing anything at work according to him, like most gov jobs in Saudi, his friends would check in then sleep at home.

I have an European citizenship inherited from my mother, which I knew about a bit too late and thought about leaving to English-speaking European Union country like Germany or Netherlands, but I had no money at that time. My parents stepped in to help with ""promises"" but they kept changing their mind just when I was about to leave to the said country after preparing for months. They're financially very comfortable and even managed to helped distant family siblings very generously while building a house from scratch in Lebanon while paying rent in Saudi etc... During the time I was asking for their help they dropped tens of $ on house decoration.  
I eventually went back to Saudi with my mother when it went so bad (fuel shortage for a year), mid 20s at the time, I looked for jobs in Saudi, and I was rejected by many for something that is apparently illegal to do and no complaints helped.

The way it works is that most jobs are now on Saudization program applied online, which forces companies to go through a government middle-ware when applying to filter out non-Saudi applicants, it requires the Saudi ID and passport on every CV/letter submission, despite it being accepted and verified their replies was ""We hire Saudis only"", but of coarse I'm a Saudi... My guess is my name wasn't Saudi and thought I was a scam, despite getting green lit by the screening.

After years of struggle I eventually let loose, lived with my parents without looking for a job, no prospects or plans, working on side projects for portfolio and learning languages for that trip to Europe when I manage to save enough.

I'm very reluctant about looking for a minimum wage job and facing a recruiter face to face since everytime I go out to a public place, I get made fun of one out of four times, unlike my parents due to my young age, maybe.  
This is my fault of coarse and my biggest weakness. I need advice & help on how to be stronger.

Not to mention that the minimum wage jobs tend to be full of tribalist and religious people, the same people I grew up with at school, while in middle class jobs Saudis tend to be tolerant and very progressive, not enough to make friends with though, some even discriminate Saudis from different cities but nowhere as close to Asians and some pan-Arabs. White people are very well respected, and western black, not Sudanese or Saudi black though.

Few examples from last year

* Went to a pharmacy, got asked why am I still here by the cashier, to give you context tons of Lebanese were laid off during that time, then he started making fun of my dialect while speaking in Syrian dialect.
* The other time I was in a bookstore and the same thing happened with a teenager, he called me effeminate in Syrian, for those who don't know some Arabic dialects sound very soft compared to Saudi. He didn't stop until I left the area.
* When I went to renew my Saudi ID, the entrance security kept asking me questions about how I happen to be a Saudi, then telling me I don't look Saudi enough since I wasn't wearing my costume properly which I was, and it's not even required to wear, but I did it beforehand since my father suggested doing so as he got harassed previously. Then the officer harassed me for sitting on the chair without permission while everyone sat without questions.
* My mother being told to cover her face in border stops in times when it's not obligatory anymore, especially for foreigner looking, he only did that after my father showed his Saudi ID, then he shamed him.
* Airport x-ray staff grabbing my stuff and tossing them in the bin like a Frisbee while maintaining eye contact. I could go on forever...

The point is I fear of working alongside certain people even if it's temporarily just to save and get away from the country, I feel like I would completely break down and kill myself, I don't want to experience my childhood again. My parents constantly call me a loser since the age of 7 and when I ask for help they never say no, they make excuses and make fun of me behind my back. My mother told me almost everyday in grade three that I will become a garbage man because I can't memorize religious scripts, I came from school beaten up, only to be beaten up at home for asking to rest. My parents ignored me completely until my teens when it got bloody coming from school.

Just to be clear I'm not shaming Saudis or anything, they're like a dichotomy, the nice ones are incredibly good people, my bus driver cleared the entire second front row for me when possible, I sat in the front, the school owner drove me to home in his car a day before the weekend, the principal made the entire school search for my pen back after it got lost and punished the student... from my perspective, older Saudis (40+) seemed much friendlier at the time.

It's not about my pride for not begging my parents them for help which could change my life, since my friends suggested me to do so, but it's a long story of abuse and mistrust growing up, my father has never spoken a single word to me for decades despite living under the same roof, he only mumbles and groans, and only to me. My mother sits in the middle and passes the word if I need something from him like a middle man.  
Whenever I want to talk to him or ask for help regarding this, he increases the TV volume to max.

I think it's generational issue since my grandpa was very harsh on his kids even as adults, he burned the bridge with his family just after marriage. Both sides grandparents disowned me, one literally told me not to call him grandpa while being nice with my parents, I've got no one to ask for a little help.

I find it hard to talk to therapy, since last time I went to one here which took a lot of convincing from parents and only got one chance, I got told I'm not religious enough, I'm not praying enough which is to be expected.  
When talking to online western therapists they often think that it's not possible by repeating the same questions every session because there are many foreigners that are happy here, they don't believe me.

Most foreigners and expatriates in Saudi are living in bordered compounds or communal living and special schools that teach education not just religion (known as international), the government bans Saudis from studying there due to mixed sex and lack of religious studies. They recently opened them to Saudis by switching to single sex and 3 hours of Quran per week or so I'm not sure. Not in my time though.

The non-Saudi Lebanese/others live in a bubble as a result, and venting to them or talking about it make it look like I'm a racist against Saudi, they do encounter events like these but very rarely since they aren't integrated like in my case, and they work in companies that are majority foreigners. The only time they bump into Saudis are malls and public places which are forgiving and tolerant.

Enough rant I guess, any advice is greatly appreciated, The Saudi subreddit has banned me and my post a year ago despite gaining upvotes and few helpful questions. I'm hoping an Asian living in Saudi to see this and provide some tips since I hear a lot of them face the same issues, and they're way more common than my type, they're usually Saudi father, Asian mother, Asian looking child.

Right now I'm thinking about moving to the east side of Saudi since they seem to be friendlier yet financially risky, go there get a job then leave the country to a less racist country I suppose. That would be another post for r/IWantOut.

deleted,I’m tired of being insecure about my hair ! ,"Working in a place that is predominantly Hispanic, I get a lot of comments about my hair that are making me feel bad. I wore my natural hair (styled by the way. Wash days take me 5 hours or more). Someone asked me today why my hair was “messed up”. I’m tired of the standard of straight hair. People don’t even realize how much time and effort goes into our hair. In the past I’ve got questions like “what happened to your hair” anytime I changed it. Kids are more brutal, so working with them has really opened my eyes to colorism and texturism. What they say is truly a reflections of how they view things and what their families are teaching them. 

I know these micro aggressions come from a place of ignorance and not really understanding our hair, but it truly is hurtful! It makes me feel like there is something wrong with the way that my hair naturally grows out my head. I literally feel anxiety about changing my hair. I get stressed about the reactions that I’ll get the next day.

Specialist-Young5753,I cant do this shit anymore!,"As a minority living in a generally racist country, feeling hopeless and yearning to leave (I will, when i finish my education), if I refuse to be exploited, highlight the double standards, or try to stand up for myself, I get smitten down, from their point of view I am just a horse of burden, if i don't produce capital for my bosses, then I am useless, I saw every demographic in society fulled by their insecurities, re-aim it and re-projected on me, so of course I get treated as a fully able adult when I just don't know how to do something in a work place or at school, yet I am ""dumb enough"" to never hold power.

To get my abilities and skills questioned all the time, even if I can clearly demonstrate them, I have to do double the work and get half the recognition. And the best part is: if you cannot see this from the inside and experience it yourself, you cannot see it at all!

renner_world,Have You Internalized Oppression or Experienced Learned Voicelessness?,"I think learned voicelessness is a symptom of internalized oppression. When individuals are constantly exposed to oppression, their internalized devaluation and assaulted sense of self lead them to be voiceless.

When the COVID-19 pandemic brought heightened anti-Asian hate to the US, I experienced discrimination as an international student from China. Not only from people yelling at me on the street, but also from one of my roommates, who singled me out and asked me to wear a mask 24-7 in our dorm. I felt suffocated both by the mask and by the way my roommate treated me.

At first, I did not realize it was a request that was made only to me due to racial discrimination. It was only when I told my two other roommates about the incident and asked them to sign my room transfer form that I realized what had happened. They identified my experiences as racial oppression, whereas I had initially thought, ""I don't know. Maybe I've done something wrong... It's understandable for her to be afraid, even though I took my temperature daily to prove I didn't have a fever."" The emotions and experiences were too complex to name. I was preoccupied with self-doubt and lacked the courage to ask for help until I reached my emotional limit.

I felt heard when my roommates validated my feelings, despite their different racial and cultural backgrounds. Their offer to report the discriminatory behavior to our school made me feel supported and protected. However, being afraid of the complications for both my roommate and myself, I didn't submit the report. Instead, I requested a bed-to-bed switch—not for me, but for the roommate who had discriminated against me.

When telling this story to other Chinese friends who had experienced racism, I did not tell the part about not submitting the report. I felt this decision wasn't brave enough and didn't want to discourage others from speaking up. However, when I became more aware of reactions to oppression, I realized it was understandable for me to be unable to advocate for myself at that moment when I felt overwhelmed and powerless. I had already taken many brave steps, to talk to my other two roommates, to make changes. Additionally, my brave self-disclosure to peers about this experience helped others in similar situations to name their experiences and provided a safe space for them to share their feelings.

During my gap semester after college, I interviewed about fifty Chinese-speaking individuals about their experiences with oppression (reaching out). Their stories deeply resonated with me. However, the intense emotions I experienced during these interviews were processed and expressed in unfamiliar ways. While anger was a familiar emotion to me as a survivor of CPTSD, this time it manifested differently, leaving me feeling drained. I realized that my struggle stemmed from the hope of making changes, which conflicted with the helplessness I had internalized through the cycle of socialization that strong structural and political oppression made me feel I have no power to make any structural changes. I observed how societies are designed to help those already in power and to exploit those who are marginalized.",2024-10-06 16:13:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1fxk3kp/have_you_internalized_oppression_or_experienced/,racism,False

Hi everyone

A few months ago, I was with my mum, who wears a hijab, and we were targeted in a grocery store. A man (he was African) threw a big juice bottle toward her and yelled hateful things.

This wasn’t the first time something like this happened, another man had shouted slurs at me and my family before.

These incidents keep replaying in my mind, especially when I wake up, and it’s been affecting my mood and daily life. I’ve tried talking to family, but it hasn’t helped much. 

If anyone has been through something similar, how do you cope with replaying it over and over? I’d appreciate any advice.

When we arrived, we were told to wait until the previous group left and enough people had gathered. The staff provided us with some information and precautions before entering.

For context, we’ve lived in the States for over 10 years (12 years for my friend and 20 years for me, to be exact).

incandescent_cat,There's an increase in racism towards Indians,"Now, I get that some Indians are all the stereotypes. But that doesn't warrant such blatant racism that's been aimed towards Indians recently. It's honestly disheartening to see us being attacked for just existing. 

There's a billion of us so even 1% bad apples are a lot. And I agree that these people are deserving of criticism. But condemn the actions and not the race. Condemn the individuals and not the color. 

Also, I see a lot of ""go back to ur country"" or similar phrases. Immigration is how some countries even formed to what they are today. As long as it's legal and they are following the rules, they don't deserve this reaction. 

Another thing I often see is how Indians are smelly or have bad hygiene. Western countries were literally afraid to bathe at one point. But also, again, maybe less than 1% and yet it's a stereotype that is used to insult.

Affectionate-Fix2485,Racism! ,"I hold a greater level of respect for individuals who openly acknowledge their prejudiced beliefs than for those who attempt to conceal their biases, even to the extent of convincing themselves that they are not racist. 

This form of self-deception, where one denies or rationalizes their discriminatory attitudes, can pose a far greater threat to people of color. 

The subtle and often unconscious manifestations of racism from individuals who believe themselves to be impartial or fair-minded can create insidious barriers, perpetuate systemic inequalities, and undermine the lived experiences of marginalized communities. 

Such covert racism is particularly dangerous because it is harder to identify, challenge, and dismantle, allowing prejudiced attitudes and behaviors to persist unexamined and unaddressed within social, professional, and institutional settings.

I used to have boys be interested in me and be able to have a crush knowing I had a chance ,but now I don't even think about dating/relationships. 

I've stopped catching the bus because the 'jokes' which is just straight up racism has gotten so bad. I miss my old school so so much even though I had gotten jumped there, because at least I wasn't bullied for who I was but the actions and choices I had made. 

I cant even ask my parents to move because I already begged them to move to this school, I feel so alone and I just want to transfer back or to another school.

Daedelus77975,Exodus,"Finally….i left the backwards town I was living in. 

The town…Hexham, UK. The worst experience of my life. A person should be able to get on with their life in peace but this place haha, wow! I was a celebrity everywhere I went it felt like. Walking down the street and people would look at me like I had a third arm coming out my chest. Point and laugh as they drove by, laugh in my face as I walked by, when I don’t even know the tosser. Or sing jungle songs. This place really is in a place of its own. Some are ok but the majority I came across weren’t . It’s scenic, and nice looking. The people have a good front, but that’s all it is. Ever seen Get Out! Watched it again recently and it gave me ptsd. 

When I first moved there one thing was said to me repeatedly…”the people can be backwards at times but they are nice” and this was said over and over again during my first 6 months or so. After thinking about it I realise what they were doing. Getting their excuses in. I really underestimated how things would turn out. I knew it would be challenging but not how it ended up being. My exodus from this hell has lasted a few months now and I keep thinking about every strange encounter, response, and interaction I had there that didn’t make sense. I know now that this was down to what was said behind my back to others. Lies and conjecture. All for what, I do not know. Drives me crazy still. Having weird people come at you out of the blue and talk at you. You don’t know them. Never seen them before. But there they are, talking about things that suggest they think they know me. Or testing me. Interrogating me. 
Or I meet someone for the first time and it’s a good experience. Then I see them again and they act weird. I see now that I needed to act exactly how they wanted me to in order to get along. I’m sure if I was the same race I would not have these issues. And this is the essence of what racism is about, make NO MISTAKE. I do not want to have to smile all the time, get on with everyone and be involved in everything and everyone’s business, but this is the requirement. Others do not, they could just be. Act natural…I am no celebrity but I had to have the mentality of one to have any life there. By the end, they destroyed every relationship I had. Not that all were particularly important to me. Some were just plants, there to observe me or make notes and see what kind of person I was etc. The others, well that’s all done now. And all I’m left with now is negativity towards the entire town. And the backwards people. There were even strange occurrences in the hospital. Interactions with some staff were just…weird. You would think a certain level of interaction would yield a more normal response but……


I know that there is a factor I am missing. As always with this kind of racism, they fixate on you and have people stab you in the back in multiple ways that you aren’t even aware. Monitor and report on you to their network of inbreds. Even influence your working relationships, and harass you in every way that they can. It’s you against them. And why? Because I existed amongst them, standing out in a way that brought out an undesirable reaction in most. Making me feel uncomfortable a lot of the time. I genuinely believe that some people just do not know how to react in certain situations and their defaults kick in instead. Then they rationalise and get defensive when confronted🙄

All in all, do not ever live there as a minority. And especially as a single person. The insular and backwards nature of the place will drive you crazy. I went there a different person than what I came out. And I wasn’t the only person they drove crazy. It’s a horrid place. And I simply cannot let go of how they screwed my life up there. I was so desperate to leave. And now I’m out, all I want is justice/vengeance. I am now left with only rage. 

Avoid this town at all costs. If youre a minority and you drive by it, stop in for a beer or food if you must, sure, then F off as soon as possible! Get Out!!

at practice theres this guy (lets call him Opp, because he is one) that always takes the chance for insulting and berating me, he always says that im ass at basketball and it shouldnt be possible because of my ethnicity, and Opp being an ass prompted anotheer 2 guys at practice to be like that to me too

Powerful_Sandwich_74,Racism and Profiling,"This is something in my opinion that we all have to deal with being a minority. Expect it, and it won’t upset you as much. Never put yourself in a position to be singled out and if you do, again, expect it. I’m a big strong black man with “one of those faces”. I am constantly looked at as being a deviant, ridiculed, and made an outlier if I don’t do everything I can to fit in with those around me. Where others can just be, and act natural. I have to be superhuman in how i interact. Always engage, smile, be funny, interesting and interested from the start. Any deviation and they just single me out and set upon corrupting my person. Then when you walk around not looking happy, have the audacity to say I have a chip on my shoulder. Fact is, whether you like it or not, conformity is key. You have to put yourself amongst people who are comfortable around you without making a spectacle of you and don’t know how to react, or treat you. 

All adverse treatment of people due to difference will never be wiped out. They will either put on an act or simply be ignorant and act out. Then rationalise and deny any wrongdoing. It is aggravating. And if you do let it get to you and you act out, you will be the one targeted and cast out. It’s nature’s way of keeping outliers at bay. As difference is often an indicator of someone potentially dangerous. But this is not always the case. But we aren’t evolved enough to react accordingly. Often it’s the cast that difference is singled out, then they turn that “outlier” into someone dangerous by using their humanity to deform them I.e. character deformation. Stopping them from forming healthy relationships that will make them happy functioning people in society. Complaining will only make things worse too. The only way to make them see is giving them undeniable proof of their issue. Or having someone else tell them after observing it for themselves. 

It is what it is. Just either keep to yourself, or cherish the relationships you have and take unhealthy interactions as a pinch of salt. Never let it get to you. Accept this as reality and adapt.

Powerful_Sandwich_74,Being Black Pt 1,"So after so long I finally left the backwards racist town I’d been living in. It amazes me how many people still don’t know that racism is not about being called an offensive name or being singled out and physically attacked. Racism extends out to more than that. And these people were terrible for the most part. I couldn’t walk down the street without putting up with being reminded I was not of the majority race. And how ignorant and arrogant they were about it to be so rude, and not know it. Wow. It was the most backwards place I have visited. And they are oblivious lmao. And when I enquired about their openly unacceptable backwards mentality, the answer was basically “because of your ethnic origin”. They reacted, I reacted. And I admit, I reacted poorly. Like ANYONE would. But it was justified. Someone needs to go there and bring them up to speed on what’s going on outside of their small, incestuos, insular, backwards town. It was so racist it’s funny. I would often p myself laughing about it. What a nightmare experience. You could never tell who was genuine and who was acting based on what someone had said. They treated me like I was a different species. An extra terrestrial walking down the street with one extra extremity poking out my backside. They were ridiculous and obvious about it. 

I think ultimately some types of people just should not interact. The ignorant and the arrogant should be avoided at all costs. Or you become like them, or twisted by them. I cannot forgive or forget what they’ve done. How I was treated, like a different species, singled out and persecuted. I should be used to it by now really. It stays with you, all of it. They will get what’s coming to them. I’m not one to let certain wrongs go unattended to. They have intentionally tried to damage my life and my character. In a manner that affected me personally and beyond. No way they get away with this. Everyday for a year now I have thought of nothing more than revenge. 

It’s a town with such a nice outside perception, the reality is very very different. I mean granted, I expected some of what happened. But I could never of expected all of it. I am enraged everyday, EVERYDAY. Especially in the morning. I have a mind that sees what things are and doesn’t lie to me for the most part. I cannot let blatant wrongdoings go. No matter what happens. I’ve let alot of small things go in my life and people told me I was soft for it. But I was right to. But this….no. Never.

Routing_God,I am sick of people being racist to Indian immigrants for no reason!!,"Long post warning!!!

I live in Sydney, Australia and I have to mention that I love this country. It is beautiful, peaceful, clean, provides a very good quality of life and I am very grateful to be here. I am originally from India and moved to Australia in 2017 on a permanent residence visa. I find mostly people here are nice (or at least nice on face) and I generally don't see any racism on everyday basis (I work from home and rarely go out so that might be a factor) . While I understand that expecting everyone to be nice and cultured is wishful thinking what I don't understand is how someone could have so much hatred against a fellow human just because he/she is from a different race. Recently an Indian girl (not related to me) was walking her dogs in a park when a bunch of while folks confronted her for no reason and spat on her. They called her all kind of racial things and asked her to go back to her country. Now this girl is shit scared and feels uncomfortable when going out of her house. These kind of things can leave a life long impact on someone and can really harm a person's mental health. 

Even generally on social media I find people's hateful comments on Indian immigrants for some reason. Now, I will agree that India is not the best country out there and there are a lot of shit practices in the country, the scam call centres are not helping either, however, why are people hating honest tax paying immigrants who never did anyone anything wrong. Almost every Indian I know here is paying his taxes, not involved in anything illegal, moved here legally, not taking any unfair government benefits and respects the country and culture. On the other hand people from some specific ethnicity always work cash, take government benefits, mostly moved here illegally and are involved in criminal activities. Some specific communities don't even believe in the country's constitution and are asking to implement their own religious law in the country. Still every racist asshole likes to pick up on Indians and never utters a single word against these other communities (I have no problem with any other community as long you pay your taxes and not involved in anything illegal) . I think the reason is because Indians are easy to pick on and don't generally retaliate (honestly makes you a coward for picking on people you know will not fight back). 

Some on internet will give stupid arguments such as government is bringing all these Indian migrants here in bulk and giving them some imaginary assistance to out job the locals. Do you even realize how hard it is to migrate here on a permanent residence? Just check the immigration website and you will realize if every Aussie was put through the same immigration process almost 95% will not qualify for a visa. I grew up in extreme poverty, had no one to guide me, no government assistance of any sorts but I worked really hard and achieved success in life. If a migrant from a third world non English speaking country with no support can out job a local then maybe you just suck in life. My intention is not to brag but for anyone who thinks immigrants are here just to enjoy benefits and not contribute let me tell put few things in perspective. I have paid more than 600K in taxes in my last 7 years here (excluding mrs), I support an Australian charitable organization and I don't take any unfair government benefits. Similarly, a lot of Indian communities support charities, Indian community I am part of donated a big amount to affected people during the Australian fire in 2020. I personally know an Indian guy in the community who is financially not that stable and even he donated 500 AUD. 

A vast majority of Indian migrants are very hard working and law abiding citizens. We are blamed to not integrate with the culture of the country we are migrating to but let me ask you what is really integrating into the culture? I greet people with a smile when I meet them, I enjoy going to the beach, I take my kid for swimming classes, I enjoy barbecue, I stop to help people when I think they need my help, I pay my taxes, I don't do anything illegal, I am teaching my kids to be a good human and contribute to the society, I like to play video games, I like to exercise and I do enjoy the local food. My wife likes to celebrate Christmas (we are not Christian) and every year she decorates the Christmas tree in our house ( damn tree cost me a lot of money :) ).What else would you have from us for you to treat us like another normal human being? 

I am not sensitive to casual racism but honestly spitting on someone just because he/she is from another race is downright diabolical. I am completely against mass immigration and anyone who enters the country illegally,  and I understand people's frustration with immigration and it's impact on property/rental market. However, the right way is to push government for correct policies not going around and spitting on people. Honestly, I think racist people are just losers who always blame others for their failures and incompetence. I have seen racist comments like ""who will pick my Uber eats if Indians became doctors"" but the reality is that there are so many Indian doctors here. I know Indian immigrant families who started from nothing and both their kids are doctors now. I am not sure what am I going to achieve ranting here but I think this incident with this girl has me really questioning how pathetic and low life a racist person can be.

vernalbug8911,First Racist Experience ,"I think I was racially discriminated because I am Mexican or am I imagining it? I've been thinking about it all day, even right now. I went clothes shopping at Ross and when I approached the fitting room the first person to attend me was very polite. She asked how many I had and I told her four, she counted the hangers, gave me a number and sent me to the dressing room. I came back out and decided to sift through the clothing racks again. I pulled out two more and I went back to the fitting room. And the person that attended me before wasn't there anymore but a white older woman. A white woman was ahead of me and she did the same thing I did before, she told her the number of clothes gave her a number and let her ahead. When I went up to do the exact same thing I did before and the lady before me, she immediately cut me off and said ""read the sign, it is in English and SPANISH,"" emphasizing that it was in Spanish. This was completely uncalled for because I initially spoke to her in English, I have no accent because I was born and raised in California and my first language has always been English. I explained to her again in English, that I already tried on four clothes and wanted to keep them and try on two new ones, I even showed her which two. She again looked at me like I was talking to her in an accent or in a different language, and said ""well what do you want to do?"" in a very rude tone. I finally emphasized that I wanted to buy these four and try on these two, again showing her which two, I had no idea how else to explain this to her. She rudely yanked them from my hand and put them on a rack and said to me ""I have to pat these, and also you are on camera and being recorded."" Finally, she gave me the clothes and number and let me into the fitting room.

This entire experience made me feel humiliated. I did not give any indication that I wanted to shop lift, I wore leggings, a t shirt and I didn't have a purse, only a small wristlet. I don't understand why I was treated like a shoplifter when I did the EXACT same thing with the previous employee and the white woman in front of me. I can only come to the conclusion that I was racially profiled because I am Mexican and she assumed that first I couldn't speak English, when I approached her I spoke in English and again, I have no accent or dialect, secondly, I was profiled as a shoplifter because my race is Mexican and the lady that was in front of me was White and she wasn't treated disrespectfully and acted the same way I did, and I wasn't profiled as a shoplifter when I interacted with the previous employer. Ross is one of my favorite stores but this experience has left me completely embarrassed and has discouraged me from going to the store again. Living in a state that majority of the population is White I've never felt or been treated this way. So I'm like still thinking if I was racially discriminated or it was imagination.

It's like society decided to betray you one night, and their plan came to execution the next morning. On every day I am always hearing racial slurs, interacting with people being aggressive and seeing how friends and colleagues turned against me. I have unprofessional clients keeping me outside of emails and responding to my colleagues instead.

And it’s was the team of 4 who did its

 everyone was dead silent and looking at me obviously I'm the only black person.  I was horrified and humiliated and hurt and embarrassed. Everyone looked like the wanted to laugh. And the worst part is SOMEONE VITED FOR THE N WROD??? And it was the guy on MARYS team. And she goes “ I DIDNT VOTE THAT”


And then I turn to Taylor and I'm like I want to leave now. We start to leave and the 4 are like you guys are leaving?

And I flipped out on them of course I was like you're awful for saying that and embarrassing me and just being racist overall. And my bestie did too And then we left. 

Mary said sorry and I’m working to forgive her and the got her people tried to say sorry but it sucked I’ll post a ss of one of the texts.

Like can we give you a hug?? Like NOOOOOOO.


Idk it was awful and they did it on purpose and I’m so hurt and sick about it I have been so sad all day. Idk what to do . People are so mean and I just can’t imagine doing that to someone.

Seems they were expecting someone of a more lighter tone. After I find the place I message the owner hours later. I get ignored.  Message again get ignored again. So it was obvious they didn’t want me there. Took a look at a place yesterday. I thought ok simple enough. I’ll take it. I message this other owner of a different place today and I get another roadblock that she “hasn’t made decisions yet” I already knew from that what she was implying.

today i was on a walk with headphones on when someone driving in a truck rolled down his window and repeatedly yelled the n word at me, a week before this someone did the same and yelled “monkey” at me. i live in a liberal town in a blue state. i’m tired of this and i know i don’t even have it as bad as others. it hurts my heart heavy and has affected my self worth so much how do i deal with this ? i don’t know how to handle this anymore i can’t shove the feelings away anymore they keep creeping out ",2024-08-12 06:44:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1eq6vt5/racist_experience_today_having_a_hard_time/,racism,False

FitBug1181,Faced racism for the first time yesterday ,"I am female (25) an international student in Canada( Indian to be specific). Long story short I was coming back from a shop and was silently walking down the street minding my own business. Suddenly a white lady started shaking and cursing out and said fuck.. fuck.. fuck off, go back to India. Practically yelling at me. I was so taken aback that I didn’t even understand what had just happened. I was literally very shaken and confused. Up until this time, I had only saw the recent hate towards Indian on the internet but encountering it first hand was something else. Now I know that this is nothing compared to what other people  experience in their day to day lives. I just wanted to take it off my mind I guess.

JackCastle,Why is racism such a default for many white people? ,"Im not here to start an argument but , just genuinely curious what is the psychology behind it. Ive seen so many what I thought were good people default to racism the moment they get angry or as some poor attempt at humor etc.. Its like a knee jerk reaction. I really don't like grouping people together, and I don't believe all white people are like this but it is something I have noticed. I mean reddit alone is a good example of it , that or if you play video games. The amount of times I've heard someone call someone a slur just randomly, in like a little moment of frustration or whatever is numerous at this point, even if the person is not even associated with the slur. Its honestly really weird to me.   
Something else that's really strange to me is the low brow humor associated with racism, someone could just say the N word and it would make them giggle. I wish I was joking but genuinely that's also something I've witnessed a number of times that's really weird , no joke no reasoning just saying the word and that garners laughs from people.   
I guess being a minority myself I'm not ""in on the joke"" I mean I'll say this alot of it doesn't seem like genuine racism, but I do feel it feeds into the worsening social structure and race relations as a whole none the less. I think it mostly stems from ignorance, and just reaching in our little animal brains for the most disgusting thing we can do or say to another person.   
I dont know, there's alot to delve into and alot of examples to make along with connections that could be made, whether its how you were raised , surroundings , experiences, the media (big one) etc. It just feels very lazy at times, but I guess its just bred in our culture (western society) is probably the most likely answer here, probably the best answer I assume I'll ever get.

cavirtue,Palestinian Student- Advice Needed ,"I (19F) go to a college that is very very Zionist. I am not even comfortable mentioning that I’m Palestinian, and I have found that Islamophobia and racism against Arab is prevalent and normalized on campus. I am also in a sorority, which has many girls who are Zionists in it. I would like to make it clear that I wasn’t aware of the political climate of the school or sorority before joining. I still want to make the most of it and experience life like other girls. This entire situation makes me feel extremely excluded from school and having to hide my identity is not something I want to do willingly. I joined the  justice in Palestine club at my school in hopes of Advocating, but I cannot even explain to you how excluded and VILLAINIZED students who support Palestinians become. I’m not sure what to do for this upcoming year because I am unable to transfer from the school, and honestly feel not only in danger, but extremely uncomfortable. Last year I did tell many students, including Zionists, that I was Palestinian because I was unaware of the political climate at my school. Therefore, I fear that this has led to excluding me from activities and people. There have been multiple people who have refused to speak to me and I am SURE it’s because I am Palestinian. I am unsure what to do and I don’t want to hate my life. This school has honestly made me miserable and it is a CLEAR privledge towards white Jewish students which I have never experienced before, so much so that I (as much as I hate to admit it) have wished that I was Jewish or not Palestinian so that I could live life in peace. This is ignorant and stupid as I understand that my people and family in Gaza and the West Bank have to endure this matter, so some racism isn’t comparable. It’s just caused me to hate my college experience no matter how hard I try. It’s like ignorance is the norm here. I went to a super diverse high school so I am especially not used to this.

capricorncueen,how do i respond to weird comments from BILs??,"i (25) am black dating a filipino (23) and struggling with micro aggressions from his 3 older brothers. all except my bf were in the military and grew up in a rural PA area so i have low expectations (i have black cousins in the military and she has had a change in her political beliefs as well) but i still feel uncomfortable not addressing things that offend me.  one example was the first encounter i had with one brother he was talking about being in the military with this guy who got super close with and then said “he’s so hood” and i made a confused face to which he responds “oh he’s black” and i legit was just in awe. i know filipino culture is heavy on respecting those older than you and avoiding confrontation in general as the youngest of the bunch so i don’t resent my bf for not saying anything in the moment. i however am very confrontational and am struggling to remain polite when people are being ignorant.  he’s said other stuff similar like describing anything dingy or rough as “ghetto” etc. FFWD to almost a year later and i see their text thread just the brothers and see one sent a text saying “i’m black” and another said “huh?” then he responds with  a picture of his tan lines from the beach saying “i’m black” and then the one who made the other comments last year said “you’re a black man fr”. my bf hadn’t responded but i just feel weird. 

i guess my question is how much should i censor myself when they’re around and what’s a reasonable expectation for me to have for my partner? i know he agrees with me fundamentally and he was surprised about his ignorance too but has never really challenged his family being the youngest in the family. we don’t even discuss actual politics (which is good bc i know from facebook we don’t agree there) but i want to feel comfortable when i’m around them. and if we have kids of any race i don’t want them exposed to that energy or behaviors.

deevahine_advocate,Please help me understand if my lab mentor is racist,"I'm a graduate student researcher (I joined my current research lab like 7 months ago, and was on a sort of a probationary period for 4 months so I really only started in earnest 3 months ago) at a university in the state of Michigan. I really thought they were all super accepting and supportive and nice. They're not. I am experiencing what I think is racism. I'm an Indian female masters student, and my interests are interdisciplinary, so I work at a lab in another department.

The professor heading the lab has been amazing, l've never seen any bias from him. But the PhD student who's mentoring me has been kind of passive aggressive and it hurts so much, cause I really liked her.

In 1 on 1 meetings with her I haven't seen anything weird from her (for context, she's an international student too, she's from a country in Western Asia and has been here in the US for I think like 2.5-3 years).

It's in group settings that I see a difference. She either actively ignores me and my questions or just straight up gives me a 2-3 worded reply. She does talk to the other people in the group, they're (idk how to put it better) lighter skinned people from other parts of Asia or they're American (Caucasian). And it's happened enough that I see a pattern- and I know it's not just me overthinking.
I'm not sure what l'm facing is colorism or not? Because I'm a darker skinned person and I also have a slightly there Indian accent. I always try and strike up conversation but my mental health has take a hit and I have no friends here and I feel lonely and have been having thoughts of just quitting and going back home. I didn't come all this way to be treated like a second class citizen. Especially in astronomy research, where people form all parts of the world come together and work together.

Please somebody, is this how it is supposed to be? In academic settings, do you make meaningful connections and friends? Or is what I'm facing the norm? I've reached out to the mental health servi at my university as my productivity has taken a major hit.",2024-08-02 21:26:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1eilr7i/please_help_me_understand_if_my_lab_mentor_is/,racism,False
rand0m_thr0waway_,I really hate my school,"For context, I'm 14M, Asian and living in the UK (Scotland to be exact). Just want to vent a bit because school is starting again in 11 days and I have no one to talk to about this.

Anyways, racist jokes are unfortunately the norm at my school. Some people in my classes who I've never even spoken to before casually make jokes such as getting my name mixed up with another Asian student who goes to the school. I once told the person that I find it offensive and they told me it was just a joke and to ""stop being a snowflake.""

I'm pretty quiet and avoid getting into trouble so I try my best to ignore it but it stresses me out a lot. My friends also make racial jokes but I let it slide because it's pretty much just part of their humour at this point and I also don't really have any other friends.

However by far my worst experience with racism happened a few months ago. The school day just ended and everyone was walking out of the school. As I was just outside of the school, a Pakistani girl (who I'd never even interacted with before) just calls me a racial slur, pushes me into a crowd of people and runs off laughing with her friends. I genuinely felt in danger after that and I was scared to go in to school the next day.

But anyways racism is my reason I dread school all of the time. Just wanted to get this off my chest and yeah I doubt anyone is gonna read this lol",2024-08-02 20:41:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1eiko96/i_really_hate_my_school/,racism,False

Our dog is quite timid and very scared of his dog and he made no effort to restrain his dog. So my mum grabbed a branch from the ground and tried to stop his dog by blocking it with the canopy side. But he thought she was trying to beat it and rushing to us with aggressive yelling, something like GO BACK TO CHINA and the F word. I did explain but he was very emotional and could not stop yelling and swearing at us.  To be honest, I move to Australia for 16 years and never had such a blatant racism experience. Even though I knew that he might have some mental issues and his reactions were quite intimidating to a female, I still argued with him, which attracted some neighbors attention and a car to stop by.

fumanchuu69,Diversity and racism,"The first time I became consciously aware of both my distinct ethnicity and diverse discrimination was when I was a junior school.

Having been born in the UK to Chinese parents I guess I’m what in the UK often referred to as “Oriental” or more broadly Asian.

At kindergarten/ infant school I had no conception of race or ethnicity, which I suppose is normal. At junior school it was pretty much the same except for some what I took as innocent comments on my eye shape.

At high school it all changed and up popped the evil heads of racism and ethnic labels plus group closure.

It soon became apparent that we are not all equally British, there is a hierarchy. Top of the pile being British white/pink, followed by British Asian (Pakistani/ Indian), British West Indian (black) and at the bottom British oriental (yellow). This was demonstrated each group from the top down, bullying the groups below their own.

This of course was scary, so I followed the herd and retreated within my own ethnic group, avoiding contact with old friends and making few friends outside of my group as much as possible.

At university things changed somewhat for the better, but it was still there expressed in how others interact with you, the things they said or didn’t say. That continue the same after uni and into the work sphere.

But the worse and most shocking of all, something I will never forget or understand happened in the USA.

I was there working on k2 visa (work visa) at a level 1 trauma center/ centre and after the shift one of the girls invited me to the “recovery room”, a 24/7 bar close to the hospital for drinks and to socialise, I of course accepted.

As far as I I was aware everything was normal, pleasant, civilized until shortly after going to the rest room / toilet.

On leaving the cubicle my gf was there saying we have to leave now; she even had my hand bag with her. We left through the back door and to say that I was confused would be a understatement to say the least.

While driving home I could see that she was fuming about something but would not say why. Once home she told me why.

One of the other woman there, an African American (poc) Resident doctor had asked her why she is involved with and brought with her a “slanty-eyed Mexican “?.

Me: ""Can I help you?"" Lady: ""You really should be writing in English, not Arabic, and don't tell me that's your native tounge, you're too white"" Me: ""It's not Arabic ma'am....it's fantasy viking..."" Lady: ""Well write in English like everyone else, you could be mistaken for a terrorist""

By now I'm half convinced this lady is on some weird drug or messed up Facebook group. I'm not a confrontational person so I get up and go to a different table. Could hear this lady whine to her husband about ""immigration"" ""Terrorists"" and to top it off ""hippies"" (Probably because I dress with a clear nature theme).

When I got my sandwich I decided to eat in the car. This lady is now referred to as an ""Old Hag"" in my journal, cus that's the closest thing to Racist Karen in viking lingo.",2024-07-08 21:54:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1dylc1n/if_im_writing_something_that_looks_arabic_ill_be/,racism,False
Hairy-Concept-9267,Racism in the name of antiracism,"A bit of a rant.

I've been noticing an unpleasant trend in discourse about racism of late particularly as the issues of anti- black, Asian, brown and Jewish racism have been called out so much within the last 4 years.

There is a tendency to impugn the character of an entire race in order to stand up for one's own. 

Examples:

* Asking 'where are the black voices denouncing black on Asian racism?'

* Suggesting that black free speech is suppressed by the excessive power of the Jewish lobby

* Framing Muslims as being an inherent threat to British Jews

* Framing Jews as being in favour of killing Muslim Palestinians.

These all examples of people implying an entire race is morally or characteristically deficient while defending themselves against racism. I see so much of this online and some offline, and yet I see so little of us minorities looking past the triggering nature of each others racism to get to an understanding of why some of us hold these views in the first place. 

I feel like we need a trauma-informed response to racism that takes it for granted that, firstly, no oppressed race has a monopoly on receiving or doling out racism, and secondly, that traumatised people do engage in problematic and sometimes hateful behaviours.

I feel like we'd be such better allies to eachother if we allowed eachother more latitude to be wrong and didn't engage in broad generalisations about eachother without working to understand origins of those generalisation. The latter is racist in itself.

As my own declaration of commitment to this outlook: I know as a black person, there are huge flaws in how some people that look like me treat other oppressed minorities, but wish deeply not to be looked down upon as more capable of hatred than anyone else. I think that is an unfair standard and I promise not to do the same to anyone else.

Intelligent-Call23,I just want to vent out,"I'm a lifeguard from Colombia, in a community pool in United States , this is my second year as a Lifeguard.

I got this neighbor that I've only seen at the pool twice. I have to check that they (the members of the community) are in my system to let them in the pool, so I ask their lastnames. Sometimes people spell too fast and I really try to get them, and most ppl are nice but this man got bothered the second time I asked him, he repeated and then left and entered the pool without me finding him on the system, I let him in to avoid any inconveniences and forgot about it.

My Gf who's also latina was watching my pool one day I was off and got this guy but he was very patient and kind to her, but spoke bad about me, he said to him I did not speak English, she just said he speaks better than me. Well, my gf is white and has blue eyes, I think that's why he is kind.

Yesterday, he got to my pool with a relative of his and they brought an American football ball, I told them that was not allowed unless it was a beach ball, immediately he started telling if I had a problem, that I always give him problems and that I don't speak English and told me if I had any prejudice to white ppl. I do not know what to think of that, he just continued saying bad things about me until my sup arrived even after I asked him to leave the pool.

It's incredible he gets annoyed just because the first day I had issues with his lastname spelling. And it seems little but all the words he said and the fact that all the other nice neighbors were watching that hit me kinda hard.

deleted,How do i stop being bothered when someone says a racist comment or joke?,"Hi! 
Context: I (F19) from India, has been through a lot of racism(ps- my skin tone comes under the warm honey shade). Since my childhood my own mother used to say shit about my skin colour, she always made me feel inferior, neglected and worthless. Growing up i never took my stand because apparently it was “okay to be racist.” I have received a lot of degrading comments about my skin colour, people joked about my skin colour alot. Imagine these kinda comments on a pre-teen, its devastating, suffocating and it can have harmful effects for a kid’s growth as well.

After a while i was done with the racist behaviour, and i wore my big girl pants and started taking my own stand. Now the thing is i become petty, sarcastic or mean while replying back to the racism. Either i go straight up to the person and express about how its not okay because some people lack empathy and basic understanding of mannerisms or i say something sarcastic like, “now ik why people don’t like you” or “ironic racism is still being a racist.” 

It frustrates me to see how these racist comments still affects me, the other day one of my “friends” said that she’s a racist and i said “we shouldn’t be friends anymore” and she legit replied me with a “youre not that dark”💀 the AUDACITY. Now she’s in my block list tho.

I wanna grow as a person, a part of which is to stop being bothered about the shitty racist jokes and comments because i don’t wanna waste my energy on the shitty insecure people who lack decency, also i dont wanna come down to their level and argue with them. So how do i deal with these situations?

Medium-Decision6449,Why Me?,"My Messed Up Relationship Experience

 

I am here to vent about a relationship that I was in the ended horribly and has forever altered the way I see/view myself and others. I was in an inter-racial relationship from summer 2022 up until spring 2023, and it was quite the roller coaster. The person I was in this relationship with lived a very monochrome life (friends, family, all social settings consisted of all white people) I was often the only Black woman at every setting he had me in. That I do not care about, being the only person of color and/or woman somewhere is nothing new to me. Here are the following things that have made me examine others as a result of this relationship:

1. **I am extremely cautious to date someone that does not take care of their mental health and uses it to be abusive**. My ex would not take his psychotropic medications for days on end and would either be hypomanic or depressed, in these moments he would say mean and hurtful things to me. When he decided to take his medications again, I would have to move on from the issue because he was feeling better and did not want to deal with the drama. Toward the end of our relationship anytime I addressed something that he did that I did not like he would tell me how he was having ideations of doing bad things. This was extremely hurtful because I had told him about my uncle that did something to himself during the pandemic and how I wished I could have been there to help him. He exploited my fear of feeling responsible for something like that to prevent me from expressing the grievances I was having in the relationship.
2. **I no longer feel comfortable opening up about things that I have experienced in my life.**  

   1. I confided in my ex that I had been SA'ed when I was a teenager, these feelings came back as a result of being physically attacked by a bouncer at a bar while helping an older woman we met at a place find her husband that basically left her with us (which was ironic because I paid for cabs and bars so that we could hang out and watch the games together) I ended up getting assaulted because they would not let my ex in because he had a passport and they wanted a State ID and the husband of the woman we were with was inside. My ex left to get cigarettes, but looking back on it and how he allowed other people to speak and treat me I believe that he saw me get assaulted and let it happen as a ""punishment"" for me not focusing on him. When I told my ex how the incident reminded me of how powerless I felt when I was SA'ed he acted like he understood only to later use it against me as I was not meeting what he felt was his ""sex quota""
   2. My ex said and did a lot things to me behind closed doors but because he has this image of being ""sweet"" ""perfect"" and just a great guy I know no one will ever believe me. His father pointed out to me in a tirade that the only reason he or anyone in the home knew that my ex and I were fighting was because of me walking away. Through therapy and other things I have now learned that my ex and his sibling were experts at reactive abuse. My ex would berate me, yell at me, and even go so far to damage things when he felt I was saying things that triggered him. If we were in the car he would punch his steering wheel and CD player and scream profanities, if we were in his room he would break his remote or anything close to him. I would be walking away because I no longer wanted to argue and/or I was getting away after being disrespected for an entire car ride.
3. **I used to pride myself on being able to relate to people from different walks of life. I thank my ex for introducing me to how some people pretend to dislike racism but actually are.** As stated before my relationship was inter-racial (I am Black, ex is White), and my ex along with his family did not think they were racist but said a lot of racist things and conducted themselves in a micro-aggressive manner. My ex's mother told me her husband is the blackest person she knows (the husband is white and lived in Flatbush for minutes during the 60s-70s), she also said how her grandmother mistook a tan Sicilian man for Black and told my ex's mother that no n\*\*gers were allowed (this statement was made at a table of his family members) no one said anything and I had to keep quiet or I would have been seen as someone that does not know how to take a joke. Also, his sibling who pretended to be my friend while simultaneously talking shit about me behind my back had her father accost me with concerns that she had never brought to my attention before. This was interesting because this sibling had no problems talking shit about her family, brother, or friends to me while also consuming substances but once it came time to address her own concerns with me she enlisted her father to do it. The father while White parades himself as an image of what he thinks Black people are. He told me to my face that I had ""too much power and needed to be taken down a few notches"" and that I seemed ""extremely angry"" when I motioned to address his daughter he intervened and told me not to talk to her. In the 6 months that I resided with them, I went from the cool black girl to an evil black b\*\*\* that there family members warned them to stay away from.
4. Additionally, my ex had a group chat with his friends called ""Bayvile N\*\*gaz but swore up and down he was not racist. I call what the sibling did racist because it reminded me of Carolyn Bryant and other white women who have feigned fear of black people and enlisted the help of white men in an effort to intimidate and/or hurt them. Toward the end when I was asked to leave the father said to my ex ""if she so much as looks at my daughter, so help me God"" I did and still interpret this as a threat. But back to the racism because it is rooted in superiority, this is the same family that ex-communicated Will Smith from their home after the Oscars debacle because he assaulted a man that was disrespecting his wife but yet find it okay for their white male father to allude to being violent toward a black woman in defense of their daughter. The town where they reside is mostly White, and the only person of color that frequents their home is their housekeeper. I am very nervous to befriend non people of color due to this.
5. **Weak people can and never will confront you alone**  

   1. My ex is an easy person to influence and is also great at convincing others. Everyone around him thinks he is such a sweet man that butter would not melt in his mouth, the only people that see his true colors are the women that he decides to date. He is selfish and hates having to be of service to and for others. Any and every time myself or someone close to him asked him for anything, he would visibly grimace. But when he was ready to ""discard"" me boy did he assemble the troops. After a bad argument he decided he needed a boys night, this was the same person that would purposefully ignore or act like he did not see the notifications his friends would send him on other occasions to have a guys night. But when he was ready to gossip about me and smear my character all of a sudden he's out drinking with the guys until 4am. Another situation that I was indicative of not only his reactive/emotional abuse and that of his sibling was when we came back from the gym one time. I knew dinner was going to be done soon and did not want anyone waiting on me so I told my ex I was going to shower after dinner. He paced around the room and pointed at the laundry and said ""I thought you were going to do this today"" I told him I forgot and I would get to it tomorrow. He paced around the room again, this time to point at an empty 420 bag. He says ""we're running low and I told him I would buy some more when I am back in the city"" he then stands still and looks me in the face and says ""I do not mean to be an a$$hole but I am afraid of germs and would like for you to shower"" as soon as I get in the shower I hear that dinner is ready, I am now angry due to the fact that my ex was nitpicking and now his family was going to have to wait for me. Looking back on the incident I understand that I was wrong for not acknowledging his family when I stormed out of the home but it was also a blessing in disguise, as my ex used my ""treatment of his family"" to create his narrative that I was a bad and/or crazy person.
   2. As I took a walk to clear my head, my ex and his sibling basically went to their dads room to air their grievances about me. After this and other instances I came home to find my ex packing up my clothes saying we needed a break, after talking and waiting on my undependable brother we ""patched things up."" It was during a sit down with his family after our ""reconciliation"" that the father addressed the grievances the group had with me as my power and me being extremely angry. My ex did not defend me nor did he own up to his role in how our relationship was breaking down. After this I posted an image on Instagram about using privilege to create false narratives, the sibling again took this to their father as opposed to confronting me. As usual they assumed I meant ""white privilege"" when actually what I was referring to was parental privilege. My ex and his family knew my mother was dead, have no father, and very small family members to being with. Plus the town they lived in was 45-60 mins away from any family I did have, which is why I felt it was cheap for her to have always have their parents confront me about any issues they had with me. I had no one to come to my defense and the only person that could had already picked the side they were on.
6. **Weak people will do weak things**  

   1. My ex did not feel empowered to leave me until his ex-girlfriend re-emerged. After the sit down with his family, I could not fight the feeling of feeling shortchanged and as though I took on the brunt of all our relationship issues on my own. I could not sleep next to him and felt uncomfortable, I looked up and asked myself ""why do I feel like this"" as this thought went through my head his phone screen lit up lol. I took it as a sign and went through it, and I found the mother load. I found messages of him talking about me to his family, I saw a message from his sibling saying how they felt bad for my ex and dealing with my bad attitude (this was after they told me they were praying for me, no wonder the prayers were not working).
   2. Then I found the messages between his ex, where she divulged that her HUSBAND did not want her speaking to my ex. During this time my ex was always eager to get to work or would stay a few minutes late, whole time he was Facetiming his ex and also talking shit about me to her. This was after he had a melt down at one of my close friends wedding for dancing with her 90 year grandfather, my ex said I was wrong and should know better because he had been cheated on in the past. Which was another trend in our relationship, I had to conduct myself as the anti-thesis of all his exs and anyone that treated him unfairly but it was okay for him to be an absolute a-hole to me. Due to the fact that I never cheated on my ex, he had no real way to ""get rid of me"" so what does he do: find problems. All of a sudden he wanted to go 50/50 on everything (I have no issue with this but I had an issue with the timing. Also, there had been times when I would take him on dates or pay for us to do things) so him bringing up 50/50 felt like an attempt at him devaluing my contributions to the relationship. He also brought up everything he had done for me, mind you this is someone that made me pay him back for half of the amount of money he spent buying Christmas presents for my family.
7. **Leave after the first red flag**  

   1. One of the biggest red flags that I ignored was the fact that my ex is the victim in every story he tells. Every ex had was crazy and was a cheater (his father also doubled down on this saying he attracts b\*\*\*\*\*\*) when the real thing is: how can so many different women from different walks of life all collectively be b\*\*\*\*\*\* when the only thing they have in common is proximity to my ex.
   2. Another red flag, do not allow someone to tell you how they feel about you TWICE. I should have left after the first time my ex tried to break up with me, but at the time I felt like I had a relationship worth fighting for. In hindsight all I did was set myself back a month in my healing.
8. **BEING ALONE IS FARRRR BETTER THAN BEING WITH SOMEONE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL ALONE**  

   1. One of the biggest things that I would always ask of my ex was to defend me. Whenever his family or my family said things to him that I did not like, I intervened and checked it. My ex could never do that for me, instead he would agree and side with whoever was not feeling me. My ex made me feel like I was a burden on his life, everything for me felt like a chore to him. He waited until we got to my friends house where were hosting a surprise 30th birthday for my best friend to tell me he was not feeling good. I get home later that night the room was littered with beer cans and 420 items, it hurt that he basically did not want to hang out with my friends and just wanted to be home. Toward the end he mentioned how he felt uncomfortable being the only white person around Black people, I think this stemmed from the conversations regarding Black people that had been had around him. I look on everything and I spent 18 months with someone that did not like or respect me. Just liked being with a black woman. It has been 8 months, and a lot of good has happened. I am still in therapy when I actually sought out therapy to be a better partner and now I am becoming a better person, I have a puppy that loves me, and I have grown closer to myself and the people that actually love and value me.",2024-06-12 22:08:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/1dej0c7/why_me/,racism,False

I was born here along with my parents , grandparents etc. Our great great grandparents came from Romania.  We are not gypsies, because we dont have their customs or language but many of us are brown skinned. I was raised in another European country where im traited like equal. They gave my chances that i would never get here because of my skin colour. Today we went to vote, along with my father.

This happens everywhere in this country. I couldn't handle that and i answered them with anger. My father later told me that this was wrong and that they discriminate us even more. And i ask myself. If you do not give the brown or black or gypsies whatever you like, a equal chance like the white folks how do you expect from them to become something better.

Patchs10,Off my chest,"I cannot get away from the incessant mental anguish that comes with being a POC in a white supremecist society. I have no outlet for inner peace. As I write this, news from Gaza aches my heart, as black and brown indigenous folks are being genocided by fascist whites, an experience so familiar to so many BIPOC through collective/generational trauma and personal experience. 

My interactions with white people in America are exhausting, anxiety inducing, and often times painful. White people will never understand the challenges they inflict on people of color through their microagressions, biased assumptions and blatant racism that they send our way each time they leave their homes. This is not to mention the responsibility they bear as perpetrators of a racist oppressive system designed by them for the purpose of continuing white supremacy and taking advantage of black and brown folks in this nation.

As black lives are being stolen on a daily basis, and rights are being taken away from our already vulnerable and distressed communities of color, I can't help but see my mental health be horribly degraded. It is so hard to find support, therapy is dominated by white folks who cannot relate to POC and I will not put myself into a position where I can be I be open with a white person, because I just know that it will end badly. I can't stress enough what Hell I go through as a black person living in AmeriKKKa.

I personally have experienced microaggressions (people calling me ugly, being the ‘left out one’ in girl groups I’m assuming for how I look, being called uneducated straight away, people assuming I’m socially awkward or don’t speak english/should have an accent, people assuming my parents must have cheated or conned their way to financial success because they believe brown people can’t be successful or whatever, being rejected from jobs more quickly, the list goes on) and racism from people from all races and walks of life, especially recently (last year). I don’t know if it has something to do with the area I live in or something but I had a look at some statistics and I found this graph from somewhere (will see if I can link it) saying that racism against female Indians in particular is getting a lot worse and is predicted to get worse in the next few years which is a pretty dull prospect 😕

One_Ear9682,Is it just me or should this be accepted ,"Tving airing “I dreamt of Cinderella” and including a whole continent doesn’t sit right with me.

First of all, I'm a huge fan korean series/ movies, I even want to visit because of the food and nothing else. 

 The episodes of the new drama “I dreamt of Cinderella” just aired and are quite entertaining, but I think scriptwriters, directors, actors have a role to play and have continually let us down as a CONTINENT that is consistently ignored and never included in your tours. 

These movies will move even if “AFRICA” isn’t mentioned. The constant disdain for an entire continent says a lot about your country, and is appalling to say the least. If it’s not coming to give us water, it’s someone being exiled to Africa and now it’s the orphanage. I’m sure there are orphanages in Korea as well(please use that!)

Also, in Africa, houses are bought and built with cash, without credit. You will be amazed at the amount of wealth. 

You all need to start doing a better job, just as we educate ourselves before visiting your country. Ignorance is not an excuse, it’s a 
disease at this point!

And I have basically since I was 9 been insecure about how I stick out with my difference of my eyes. 

Today at english class our teacher wanted us to try a new game called ""Chinese whispers.""

Im a very socially akward and overthinking person so I get very scared when anything with China or its people appear in a class or anything else. 

Because I always used to hear ""Ching chong"" or any other racist comment. 
And it felt like I was so pointed out at those types of situations. 

As the class started, I was an example of how the game works. Out of all people in the classroom. 

Wich made me so akward and nervous. 

There is plenty of other names instead of ""Chinese whispers"" Like ""Telephone"" in the UK. 

Chinese whispers was made by a Sinophobic person to mock the chinese language/their people.

And I won't blame my teacher since his a very kind person, and probably didn't know I was chinese and the history of ""Chinese whispers""

I just really want to express how I feel about this, and how it could look like to many europen asians that have gone through racism since childhood.

EarthQuackShugaSkull,Not sure how to handle this ... ,"I'm new here so just a little context. I(30f UK) am mixed race with straight hair and beautiful brown skin. I recently moved to a rural area for work at a live in job. I am the only employee of black origin, most are Caucasian, with the exception of 3 Asian dudes who don't speak much English. This being rural England there's lots of ignorance around and a fair amount of micro aggressions going on. I was once doing my job and a fellow employee asked me ""is that Caribbean thing then?"" I simply said ""no, that's a me thing, colour has nothing to do with it"", that sort of thing. Within reason I kind of let those slide for the most part and try not to take it personally, I appreciate it's mostly ignorance and I am massively outnumbered so picking out small things doesn't seem too useful. 

But I have heard the N word a LOT. Like it's just a descriptor for them, they don't understand who they're talking about and whenever I hear it it like a stab to the heart. It just makes me think of images of the civil rights movement, and enslaved people and it just makes me really upset. They say it's okay to say to me because I'm not fully black. It's not okay and I've corrected it so many times I'm starting to lose the will to be calm and collected when I hear it. For them, it's just a word, for me it really means something. It makes me so angry how cavalier they are about it. Several people want me to give them the N word pass. Maybe I'm alone here but for me, then n word pass just trivializes the word and the people who suffer because of it. 

Does anyone have any advice? Anything I can say to let them know how not okay it is? I don't know how many times I need to make myself clear on it. They just keep doing it. What can I do or say?

My team of three and I are building a Crypto Futures and Options app called SimplTrade. Most trading apps are too complex and intimidating, so we created SimplTrade to make futures trading simple, easy to understand, and fast—filling a much-needed gap in the market.

# Key Features of SimplTrade:

* Simple, user-friendly design
* Trade directly in Telegram as a Mini App
* Guided insights to make smarter trading decisions
* Accessible language for all skill levels

We’re looking for Beta Testers to help improve the app’s UX and flow. This is a paid gig, with compensation based on the value of your feedback. While we’re on a tight budget initially, we’re keen to build long-term relationships with contributors who bring value.

If you’d like to help us build the Robinhood for Crypto and make trading accessible to more people, sign up for our beta! Your input would mean the world to us.

It is still far from its 2017 ATH and even more so if you count inflation.
 
It still seems to be some liquidity for Ripple who owns 2% of its current supply and 50% of the premined yet to be released, as they please, supply. 

The arguments for it replacing swift do not have a strong footing, institutional investors don't want it. 

The only thing it has going for it is the potential dismissal of the lawsuit.
And its brigade-like current community.

It honestly seems like a huge bubble waiting to be popped. And it is concerning as it could trigger a crypto winter if too many investors get burnt. 

The more retail gets lured in, what seems to be, senseless projects like XRP, the more the community as a whole will suffer from it and it is honestly concerning.

I can see the Moons on Arbitrum Nova in my Metamask on my Android phone but of course I can't see the balance because of the migration to Arbitrum One

I want to transfer them over to my Arbitrum One wallet account but so far anyway the only instructions I found were the ones linked to the tutorial for using the Celer bridge to move Moons between Arbitrum Nova & Arbitrum One 

I have ETH on both networks but I don't remember ever moving crypto without choosing how much I want to move and I know we can choose to move a ""maximum"" amount but I didn't know if that option was available to choose if the wallet can't detect how much is in there. and really, I'm still a Moons 'shrimp' but I'd still hate to lose any amount of cryptocurrency to the dark abyss of the cryptoverse.

if anyone has a working knowledge of this process re: moving Moons between these 2 networks from  *within* Metamask please chime in, thanks!

I was so close to liquidation that I sold my entire ETH position to add more funds to my short Position on that shitcoin UXLINKUSDT. I THOUGHT the price would drop, but it skyrocketed in an inexplicable way.

I'm left wondering how they manipulate the market. Is there some kind of indicator that says, ""Hey, this guy just invested $3000, let's liquidate him""? How is it possible for the price to suddenly explode and then crash dramatically within minutes? If I hadn't been liquidated, I would have been in profit.

EffectSix,I don't want my wallet to be drained...,"I've read probably 20 posts within the past 3 days if people losing it all (usually from their hot wallets but some from their hard wallets). Yes, some people admit to doing some dumb things, but others claim they did everything in their power to protect their money and still getting drained..

I'm honestly wondering if keeping your funds safe in the long-run is actually possible or if pretty much the majority of people eventually gets burned. What do I need to do to keep my funds safe? 

The riskiest thing I do is interact with a few dApps/Dexes, which I know may end up burning me. I only access crypto websites via Coingecko links. My seed phrase is only written down. I'm paying for a VPN. I use a password for my wallet (though this doesn't matter if your seed phrase is compromised). I've ran two different antivirus scans with nothing. I do get sus 0.000001 SOL deposits to my wallets (dusting from I learned). 

I'm thinking of wiping my computer clean and creating new wallets, emails, and buying a hardware wallet. But, I still worry that no matter what, I'll be compromised. At this rate, I feel like I should just buy the top 10 coins and store them on a CEX. Idk. Thoughts?

PineappleResident254,USDT ban in EU,"Hello everyone,

I’ve heard that on December 30th this year, USDT will be delisted from all exchanges in the EU. 
All of my investments in crypto in the past years were made using USDT. I deposited EUR and converted it into USDT and then bought any crypto I wanted. Now I am wondering if I will still be able to sell my crypto in the future, especially pairs like BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT. I understand I wont be able to buy them and will be forced to change pairs to BTC/USDC for example.

For my exchange I use Binance so I am wondering if they will automatically convert it to another stablecoin like USDC? Do I need to do that manually?

Do I need to take any action before the deadline, or is it fine to just keep HODLing? I don’t usually follow crypto news, so I only learned about this recently.

Thanks for your help!


EDIT: I just talked to Binance support, and they only mentioned stablecoins restrictions that were made by MiCa mid summer this year. There is no official news of USDT or other stablecoins getting delisted (yet). If that happens, Binance would make an official announcement.

Unlike memecoins, these are supposedly backed by real-world assets, which makes them feel more legitimate and less speculative.

Are they properly regulated, or is there a risk that they could turn out to be a scam? What kind of due diligence should I do before investing in them, and are there any red flags to watch out for?

SpiteUpset3392,Satoshi's Endgame Theory,"
Satoshi Nakamoto promised us freedom from banks and central governments. He gave us Bitcoin—a decentralized currency. But what if Bitcoin isn’t just a currency? What if it’s a tool, part of a much larger plan?

Imagine this: Satoshi has been waiting, watching as the world gradually embraces Bitcoin. The United States starts building a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and other nations follow suit. By 2040, Bitcoin becomes the new gold. Countries print money to buy it, use it as collateral, and tie their economies to it. The global economy grows increasingly dependent on Bitcoin.

Now consider this: when Bitcoin reaches a $50 trillion market cap, Satoshi—who holds over 1 million BTC—would become the richest individual in history. And this is when the true power of Bitcoin could be revealed.

What if, at that moment, Satoshi sells everything? A complete liquidation. The markets collapse. Banks fail. Economies crumble. Nations falter. The world undergoes a massive reset.

And out of this chaos, a new world begins. Gone are the days of destructive capitalism. People grow their own food, rebuild local communities, and become self-reliant. No more banks. No more loans. No more slavery to the system.

What if this is the freedom Satoshi envisioned all along?",2024-12-24 02:02:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hl38ex/satoshis_endgame_theory/,CryptoCurrency,False

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the 23th month of the 2023 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 DEC Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the features in this year's (2024) Top Ten Experiment*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/)***.***
* **NOV Highlights:** All green month, **XRP** nabs both the monthly and overall leads, **DOGE** in second.
* The 2023 portfolio is **+248%** since inception vs. +58**%** from the S&P500. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+366% vs S&P500's +75% - see below for details).

# Month Twenty-Three – Up +248%

https://preview.redd.it/ohafcv3rwl8e1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=2031e6668254e82c0533ba908e9e00ffa09e218a

The 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT, LTC.**

November highlights for the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All green month
* **XRP** takes the monthly victory
* **Overall:** From fifth place last month, **XRP** jumps into the overall lead. **DOGE** is in second followed by **BTC.  MATIC/POL** is in last place and the only crypto in negative territory.

# November Rankings

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks twenty-three months into the 2023 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment – 60% of the projects have dropped out of the Top Ten since January 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/mh6as0kuwl8e1.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9136d6deda0133b9b91bd3843d7d3f26b6a3771

# November Winners and Losers

***November Winners*** – **XRP** gained a massive +319% this month followed by **ADA** (+222%)

***November Losers*** – At +13% **BNB** was the worst performer of the month

# Overall Update: XRP ahead followed by DOGE in second.  MATIC is in last place.  90% of cryptos in the green. 

**XRP** (+568%) came out of nowhere this month, jumping from fifth to first place, overtaking **DOGE, BNG, ETH,** and **BTC** in the process.  

The initial $100 invested in **XRP** twenty-three months ago is worth $669 today. 

90% of the 2023 Top Ten cryptos are in positive territory this year.  Only **MATIC/POL** (-21%) is in negative territory.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2023:

https://preview.redd.it/6l7ra7nxwl8e1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e8ab86231d5c4a1f67996ffaf283f90dd5a8c5b

The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio ended November up +248%.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2023 is now worth **$3,483**.

# 2023 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)

Last year I ran a friendly competition between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  

**AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  

Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** was an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.  At the beginning of 2023, $1,000 USD was worth 17.15 **AMKT.**  

Here was the result of that side Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/0wy9kpzzwl8e1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1acaee487148925286b0810e4d7a98436123e9

Overall winner: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).**  

In the end, it really wasn’t close – **AMKT** took 9 out of 12 monthly victories and held the overall lead throughout 2023, returning +141% vs. my Top Ten’s 73%.

At the end of 2023, the value of the **AMKT** provided by Alongside for the Experiment was donated to [The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research](https://www.michaeljfox.org/).  Since I’m repeating the friendly competition in 2024, I’ll make another donation soon.

And what if I held that 17.15 AMKT until today?  It would be worth $4,459 vs. the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio’s $3,483.

# Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2023 Top Ten is one of seven concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): up +79% (total value $1,789)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +756% (total value $8,559)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +999% (total value $10,994) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +369% (total value $4,694)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -1% (total value $991) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +248% (total value $3,483)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11): up +110% (total value $2,100)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$32,611**

**That’s up +366%** on the combined portfolio.

For context, the peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/1ekdqbg3xl8e1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=9488ddf26ae1076e238575dc9b8f7e7425fd62a6

In summary: ***That’s a +366% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/rg3pvk46xl8e1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=005c8b82dc8a0e4d9158f0363f0ef79c5d65efe9

The S&P 500 is up +58% so far in 2023, compared to the Top Ten Crypto portfolio’s +248%.  The initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,575 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,262 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,413 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,872 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,610 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,269 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,575 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,268 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $12,269.**

That is up **+75%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+366%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Crypto Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/2u8okusaxl8e1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab05a57a5db843672f3e22c9ea6bff17be82c3e

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  November’s extended report is on the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio, the one you’re reading now.  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), and [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34) reports as well.

From what I’ve read, ASI is an open-source, independent player in AI research and development, but I’m struggling to grasp its exact use cases. How does it stand out in the crowded AI and crypto space?

Does its so-called 'mining process' contribute to AI research in a meaningful way? If so, how does this process work? Can it truly accelerate advancements in artificial superintelligence?

Also, I’m curious about how independent AI organizations or companies can use ASI for their benefit. Does it offer direct research capabilities, tools, or resources that can be monetized or integrated into existing systems? Where does ASI fit in the broader business value chain?

What exactly is the deal between ASA & Bosch?

Original-Assistant-8,BTC will have no problem upgrading to the latest NIST standards. Which utility coins will benefit from preparing early?,"While we don't when BTC may look at making an upgrade, how will this topic play out in the utility space this coming year?

Vitalik has been talking about ideas and it seems they would like to pick a direction and start working on it.  As we know, major changes on Ethereum require extensive research and alignment, and the build,test, deploy can take a large effort.  And there has been disagreement on whether this work needs to start now as it takes away from other priorities.

Certainly, that draws attention to projects that already thought this should be accounted for and have built with the new standards in mind.

Coinmarketcap lists these coins as being quantum resistant because of the new standards:  
 OZO QRL CELL ABEL ILC AME QANX

Full disclosure - I bought into QANX over 3 years ago.    
  
As you can imagine there has been plenty of healthy ""debate"" among these coins that think they are best positioned to offer blockchain solutions - with no future concerns about needing to upgrade.

In general, while I came to appreciate the value of being prepared, I realize the market is unsure what to make of it.  Quantum computing stocks have certainly done very well in the last weeks.

Without playing favorites, I think all these coins still need to execute their plans to achieve adoption and usage.  They are in varying stages of development, most with a mainnet but still adding utility (QANX may be the only one that has not launched mainnet).

I do think these will all get a second look as we learn more about how quantum will evolve.  I don't see them taking share from btc, but the utility market is still pretty open of where it might go.  Should be interesting to watch.",2024-12-23 01:26:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hkcwaf/btc_will_have_no_problem_upgrading_to_the_latest/,CryptoCurrency,False

(For those who aren’t familiar with the term “in-kind redemption,” it refers to the ability to withdraw the bitcoin you’ve purchased via an ETF into your own custody. In essence, it turns a bitcoin IOU into the real thing.)""

cryptotaxcalculator,A Tax Lawyer explains the new Safe Harbour rules in 2025,"A Tax Lawyer Explains The New Safe Harbour Rules in 2025

*Hey it’s James from Crypto Tax Calculator here.*

*I’ve seen tons of questions about the new Safe Harbour rules popping up so I asked our Head of Tax to put together a bit of a guide for you to help clear everything up.*

*--*

The IRS has introduced **Rev. Proc. 2024-28**, which includes **safe harbor provisions** to help us transition from a universal/global tax reporting method to a **per-wallet** method starting **January 1, 2025**. 

Let me break it down in simple terms so everyone can understand and prepare accordingly.

# What’s Changing?

Starting January 1, 2025, the IRS wants us to report our crypto taxes on a **per-wallet** basis instead of lumping everything together. 

To make this switch smoother, they've provided some **safe harbor rules**. Think of safe harbor as a set of guidelines that, if you follow them, the IRS will consider your tax reporting to be compliant.

# What crypto is affected?

* **Only for Crypto Acquired Before 2025:** This safe harbor applies to any digital assets (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) you bought **before January 1, 2025** and still hold on that date.
* **Excludes New Acquisitions:** Any crypto you buy or transfer **on or after January 1, 2025** won’t be covered by these rules.

# What Do You Need to Do?

To qualify for the safe harbor, you need to:

1. **Ensure Capital Asset Status:**  
   * Each crypto unit you hold must be considered a **capital asset** (similar to stocks or bonds).
   * The original cost basis (what you paid for it) must have been tied to a crypto unit that was a capital asset.
2. **Same Type Requirement:**  
   * When you allocate any unused basis (leftover cost basis from selling some crypto), it must go to another crypto of the **same type**. For example, leftover basis from Bitcoin can only go to another Bitcoin, not Ethereum.
3. **Keep Detailed Records:**  
   * Track how many crypto units you have in each wallet.
   * Note how much of the cost basis is left over.
   * Record the original purchase price and the date you bought each crypto unit.

# How to Allocate Unused Basis?

You have two main ways to allocate your unused basis:

1. **Specific Unit Allocation:**  
   * **Assign Specific Coins:** Decide exactly which leftover basis goes to which remaining crypto unit in a specific wallet.
   * **Pool Allocation:** Group your remaining crypto in each wallet and allocate the unused basis to the whole group.



1. **Global Allocation:**  
   * **Predefined Rules:** Use a set rule to decide how to spread out the unused basis across all your wallets and crypto units.

# When to Do It?

* **Specific Unit Allocation:** Must be done **before**:  
   * You sell, dispose of, or transfer the same type of crypto **after January 1, 2025**.
   * The tax filing deadline (including extensions) for the year that includes January 1, 2025.
* **Global Allocation:** You need to:  
   * Describe your allocation method in your records **before January 1, 2025**.
   * Complete the allocation by the same deadlines as specific unit allocations.

# What Should You Do Next?

1. **Review Your Holdings:** Look at all the crypto you own before January 1, 2025.
2. **Choose an Allocation Method:** Decide between specific unit allocation or global allocation based on what works best for you.
3. **Keep Good Records:** Make sure you have detailed records of all your crypto transactions, including purchase dates, amounts, and cost basis.
4. **Use Tax Software:** Consider using tools like[ Crypto Tax Calculator](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/) to help manage and allocate your cost basis accurately.
5. **Consult a Tax Professional:** If you’re unsure about any steps, it’s a good idea to talk to a tax expert who’s familiar with crypto taxes.

burnzie1390,Withdrawal (Tax) related question,"I have been a long time holder of BTC and other crypto currencies… I have only ever bought and have never sold. I now have a scenario where I need to cash out some money for my family and although I would rather not sell my BTC, (esp right now while we are having a bit of a pull back) I need to do what’s right for my family and access some of the funds in my wallet.

Can someone please explain the best way to go about cashing the crypto out to minimize the tax impacts. I understand that I have to claim my earnings and report capital gains… My main question is if I had purchased on an exchange like Coinbase repeatedly over the last decade or so, but always transferred the bitcoin to a cold wallet… If I transfer it back on the exchange now to cash out, how does it know which bitcoin was bought at what price levels so I can accurately report capital gains? I see options for FIFO, HIFO, or LIFO but like, how does Coinbase know if it’s coming from a cold wallet and is then being sold? Does it just go off of my past account transactions?

Does anyone else have advice on what the best way to do this would be?

Also should I do this right now (pre 12/31) or wait till after the new year to give myself more time to prepare my tax filing for next year.

Fahim61891012,Polygon in Electric Capital Report,"The latest **Electric Capital** report focused on the developer activity in the crypto space till the year 2024. This report is based on data extracted from millions of code contribution made to blockchain platforms and include data from contributions of several hundreds of developers. It is very focused on topics such as trends within the various diverse developer communities, exciting projects within these communities, and ecosystem expansion.

Out of all the names mentioned in this report, Polygon definitely stands out. First, let’s discuss the results obtained more thoroughly.

* **Leading in Asia and South America** Polygon ranks first for developer activity in Asia and is among the top three in South America. The fact that it is most active in these locations proves how it has developed relations with local developers. This makes Polygon to be ideal for developers across the globe.
* **Over 1,000 New Developers**In this year, over one thousand new developers flocked to Polygon. This growth is in line with indications of the ecosystem’s live-lihood as well as the desire that developers have for resources that the ecosystem presents as well as the flexibility required. Polygon is very much appreciated in the community due to its easy to use infrastructure.
* **Multichain Structure** The report further comes out clearly to show that a third of developers act across multiple chains. Today it is possible to attend numerous platforms, and Polygon can be considered to be one of the most important ones in the given multichain environment. These developers are expected to coalesce into a more coherent community in the near future, thus providing a better basis for project execution across a variety of chains.
* **Among the Top Innovators** Polygon is now listed among the three leading platforms to support creative projects and is preferred by developers. Such factors as being developed for developers and having a visionary perspective explain this success.

Polygon’s influence in the developer ecosystem is poised to grow even further, promising exciting developments for both its community and the broader blockchain space.

Crawwarch,Watch ZRX,"ZRX

Can’t stand the Cheetoh-colored charlatan, but do NOT overlook the fact that Trump’s new “crypto czar” David Sacks is on the board and has long been a paid consultant for 0x Protocol (ZRX). He’s known as a SOL shill, but ZRX has been his pet project for a very long time.

This in part explains why, when Trump announced in May that his campaign would accept crypto donations, his list of accepted crypto looked like this:

BTC 
ETH
SOL
XRP
DOGE
ADA
ZRX

One of these things is not like the others (start with a CoinMarketCap ranking of 171).

ZRX is one of those coins that’s been around through every Crypto Winter and boom, had its shills that eventually grew tired of shilling, but offers a DEX platform that is as reliable as it is overlooked.

I have followed this coin since 2019. I have a very small bag, at this point, but I can’t help checking in on this one a couple times a week. ZRX has always been one of those coins that goes on its own independent runs. On a day when the market is entirely flat, you look up and suddenly ZRX is up 40%. On a day with moderate losses, you look up and CRX has doubled the downturn of everything else. It has a history of going on curious tears.

I’m not savvy enough to know what exactly this crypto czar is going to do, nor what he even could do to push ZRX. But I am quite certain that this coin and this project are only going to benefit from having somebody in this newly created, totally unprecedented position who is uniquely attached to ZRX.

I will be surprised if this coin doesn’t spike by 50-60% in the next couple months. 0x Protocol suddenly has friends in high places.",2024-12-22 19:19:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hk5ie2/watch_zrx/,CryptoCurrency,False

\- His token that is suppose to be better than Bitcoin/Ethereum and make you money is down -99%

\-His supporters ""sacrificed"" a billion dollars worth of crypto to him and in return after 3 years of waiting they received a Ethereum clone fiverr made chain full of rugpulls and stablecoins that can't stable.  The native token is also down by a lot.

\-His blows a lot of his supporters money on himself, ugly gucci suits, watches, diamonds, cars, you name it and calls it outrage marketing so it seems like this all has a purpose for his investors.

\-Even in his own paid for documentary with hex holders, theirs a guy that sold his house for 240k Hex that's worth less than 4k USD now. 

And his followers are happier than pigs in shit, they love him and will defend him even as he faces charges in the US and EU for scamming them.

5t1nk3r,PSA - X.com Scam - don’t be a dumbass and fall for something like this,"In the spirit of the constant “is this a scam?” posts, I present you with this cautionary tale.

While this particular interaction occurred on X.com, I have seen similar scams run on other platforms, including via Telegram, Twitch, (ahem) here, etc.  I know one (more probably) is going to lose their mortgage payment to an asshat like this, so please, think before you trust someone.

Red Flag #1:  I thought this person had some amusing content, and people I follow are his followers, so I clicked “follow.”  I received an almost immediately “follow back” (pretty common - follow 4 follow), but it came with a weird message (I will post screenshots of the chat). I figured the person was just weird - judging by their profile this analysis tracked.

Red Flag #2: They quickly responded to my “thanks for the follow back and the note (weird note - like - stalker weird), but I humor people sometimes. Their follow up was some obvious conspiracy theory (I can’t even tell if liberal or conservative honesty - extremists all look the same when they are far enough out) about bank failures.  Granted, could happen, there are definite bubbles in the market (real estate again) and the stock market has been threatening a crash for a while.  But I definitely got the “not just weird, but potentially deranged vibe.”  Opted to humor the guy.

GIANT ASS FINAL RED FLAG #3

For the trusting and naïve crowd - random strangers on the Internet do not have your best interest at heart. Despite all the Kumbaya, we’re all getting rich together spiel that people spew, there will be a few winners and a whole lot of losers in any market, that’s how it works. For me to get rich one of you assholes is going to have to get poor - I buy low, and then you buy high from me. That’s not being malicious that’s literally the market.

This ass hat, however it’s a fucking thief and I hate nothing worse than a fucking thief. And it makes me wonder how fucking stupid is this guy to think that I am dumb enough to fall for this obvious fucking scam. 

He suggested, being super caring and helpful for an Internet stranger, that I obtain a decentralized wallet and he was going to help me set it up and I was going to give him screenshots so he could tell me how to set it up. Do I really look that fucking stupid in my profile pic?

I’m going to post screenshots of the chat below. Please no one fall for this shit.  My initial thought was to immediately report him to X.com. However, all that would get is this particular profile of his band, he can just set up a new one and it’s business as usual.

So I think I’m gonna fuck with him a little bit. I would love any suggestions that anyone has as to how to fuck with him and troll him. It would be amazing to find to figure out who he actually is and where he is and see if I could arrange some karmic justice for him.",2024-12-22 17:55:45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk3qzt,CryptoCurrency,False
Consistent-Mistake93,Shorting stock with crypto as collateral ,"Where can I short a Nasdaq stock using crypto as collateral? Someone on /investing mentioned Dzengi, which requires KYC.

Immediate_Check_74,Ever wonder how Memecoins like Turbo Toad Token have blown up! 1 word - Community,"Communites foster growth, Trust and Positivty.

I think positivity & Trust. We all know blockchain has many uses but many of those uses have not yet come to fruition. Yet inflation is rampant.

Many research reports have studied the rampant rise of memecoins. The psychology behind it is quite intriguing. Many of todays youths feel trapped in this endless cycle of inflation. Never being able to own a home due to lack of opportunities. Some may consider it a less risky way of gambling, while others see it as a slightly riskier investment than stocks with a quite possibly way larger return on investment.

Have you heard of the guy that invested 28$ in PEPE and sold for 55m. That's crazy. You'll never see those kinds of returns in the stock market in such a short time without crazy derivatives or margin. Small Cap Stocks are primed to fail as well thanks to Naked Shorting and hedge funds. Cryptocurreny supply on major blockchains can't be fabricated like stocks destroyed.

  
Their value of crypto is in the will of the community! We need to stop fostering toxic communities that want to rug each other and instead build stronger communties

In my opinion, doing your research on ""memecoins"" can be a smarter investment with a little amount of money rather than investing in small cap stocks or large cap stocks and waiting for 30 years. The secret to the memecoins, is obviously the contract, the dev/team and the community. If all 3 of those pieces are in place then you are golden. Thanks to pump. funs launchpad, contracts are secure so you just have to verify 2/3 when selecting your memecoin. Obviously, this is not financial advice. Do your research.



On that note, I founded a memecoin, which is quite intriguing. It's a 1st of its kind. A self KYC'd memecoin. There is nothing to hide. It has a catchy fun name called Catapult Corgi.  I consider every1 in the community to be a team member! The team is doing alot of marketing 20 hours a day. Choose to believe me or not, but I have no intention of selling until 1b+ Market Cap. I'm not fucking leaving. I'm getting this corgi tatted at 1B+ MCAP. What do you guys think?

hivibes777,Beware of kraken exchange,"BEWARE OF KRAKEN EXCHANGE 

I've been using Kraken for years and almost a week ago  I deposited BTC then converted it to usdt and went to withdrawal and they disabled my account. They have given me no way to withdrawal my money and are now ghosting me. It appears there is hundreds of other stories of this happening. I got banned from their support sub just for saying what I was going through. I've called them, blown up their Twitter and reddit and they just continue to ignore me. This is a warning for anyone using or considering using them. I always see people saying this is why you don't hold on an exchange but in reality I don't, all I did was buy on an exchange and immediately tried to withdrawal it. They let me spend my money but wouldn't let me take it out. BEWARE ",2024-12-22 04:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hjrf10/beware_of_kraken_exchange/,CryptoCurrency,False

eroverton,BlackPower sidebar,"I notice the sidebar info is not very visible on mobile and I've noticed an uptick in negative posts, so I wanted to reiterate: r/BlackPower is a place for Black wins, Black empowerment, Black solutions to Black problems, Black celebration and Black success. We're here to share positive stories, examples, and resources that can help our community continue to succeed independently of anyone else's permission. This is **not** a sub for:

- ""Look how much injustice is happening to us!"" Yes, we know. If we're here, we know that. This is a place to share things that are working towards fixing the problems and building stronger communities. Constant shouting about the problems we face yet offering no solutions is not helpful. Consider using r/BlackInAmerica for those types of posts.

- ""Look how much [political party XYZ] sucks!"" Honestly, they all suck. If you know of a candidate that is *actually* (not just promising to) doing something beneficial to or positive for the community, this is the place to highlight that. A bitchfest about what the Republicans, Democrats, etc are doing again is not. ... if you want to have that argument in the comments, fine. Otherwise consider the political subs for posts like that.

- ""This Black celebrity's actions are why we'll never get ahead as a people."" Just don't. Consider taking that discussion to r/Blackfellas, r/Blackladies or even r/BlackCulture to discuss problematic celebrity culture issues. If you see a celebrity that is bringing POSITIVE things - creating jobs, building industries, investing in the culture and education - here is the place for that.

- ""Black women / Black men are the problem and in this essay, I--"" No. Don't post that shit anywhere. Sit down.

- ""White people / Immigrants / non-FBA people are the problem and in this essay--"" No. If you're focused on what everyone else is doing instead of our accountability to do things for ourselves, you are not mature enough to be here. You don't come to Black Power by concentrating on white people all day. For the purposes of this sub they are irrelevant. Focus on yourself, son. :P
 

If you can't see the sidebar from mobile, this is what it says:

Subreddit rules: This sub is for the discussion of Black empowerment topics, whether in business, finance, achievement, innovation, solutions to societal issues, or spiritual enlightenment. We focus on SOLUTIONS, not problems. Please do not post a bunch of 'look what society is doing to us again' posts unless you are posting a solution to the issue.

Vogonaut,"Semba, Cabula, Caboclos to Samba de Roda: The True Origins of Samba in Brazil","Disclaimer: I'm a Brazilian Musician and Percussionist, based in Brazil. This history is both bound by oral history, as well as scientific studies (there are more sources in Guide, link below).

First off: What is Samba?

**Samba** is a general term for **various cultural manifestations** that take place in Brazil. It’s a **fruit of the African Diaspora** and the interplay between different cultures within Brazil. It **originated in Bahia**, in the Reconcavo region, and became one of the most important symbols of Brazilian Culture.

**Where did Samba Begin?**

Salvador was the **original Brazilian capital,** the first effort to organize the exploitation of the Colony. It became an important port for the **Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade**.

One of the most expressive examples of the African Exodus, Diaspora molded the city as is today. It’s known to be the blackest city out of Africa, where African Culture and Religion are still worshiped, such as the worship of Orixás, Voduns, and Nkissis.

**Brazil alone** stood for **40% to 45%** of all Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Even after being the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, illegal slavery and corruption rolled on for decades. From 1826 to 1850, 1.662 enslaved Africans disembarked in the United States. In Brazil, there were 1.099.018 disembarkments in the same period. [Source](https://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates)

It’s evident why Brazil has the most African descendant population in the Americas, as well as why it has the second largest Black population in the world, after Nigeria.

Salvador and the outlying regions of the State of Bahia were the African melting pot of the 19th Century. African Cultures encountered in Diaspora, from the Muslim West-African people to Occidental Africans. These Africans brought their spirituality, and in Brazil, they made Candomblé. This new religion was based on old roots, the major being: the Yoruba, Bantu, Gêge, and Fon people. A rich cultural mix was present, nurturing cultural expressions and rhythms present in Brazil, such as capoeira and Samba de Roda.

**Samba de Roda is the first form of Samba**

**Samba de Roda,** which could be freely translated as **Samba of Circle** (of People) is recognized as the first form of Samba. Its origins are in the middle 1800s in the region of ‘Recôncavo’. It is home to the Historical cities founded within close reach of Salvador.

‘**Recôncavo**‘ was all coastal and interior regions of the ‘**Bahia de Todos os Santos’**, which can be translated as **All Saints Bay.**

When asking what is Samba, it is important to understand that there were many other traditional cultural expressions on its side. 

The word **Samba** comes from the Bantu Semba or Massemba terms which remount to the ""*Umbigada"" (navel)*, a dance that survived the Trans-Atlantic voyage and is basically a part of the *Samba de Roda* dance, where the person in the circle does a navel-to-navel (Umbigada) dance move, and the person who received it goes to the center to dance. **It's the same origin of the word** ***Semba,*** an Angolan rhythm, although they are **different rhythms and traditions**, stemming from similar origins.

In Brazil, Samba de Roda was part of a group that also contained rhythms such as Barravento, Capoeira, and Congo, all united within the Afro-Brazilian Communities. The rhythms were also permeated by the symbols, chants, and culture that originated in Candomblé houses, the **‘Terreiros’**.

Samba de Roda is ever-present in **Candomblé** and other Afro-Brazilian religions. The rhythm is especially played to the spiritual entities from the Brazilian ground.  Cabila or Cabula, sometimes called Samba de Cabila or Samba de Caboclo, is certainly one of the main rhythmic sources and origins of Samba de Roda.

Samba de Cabila, Samba de Caboclo, and Samba de Roda are played to **‘Caboclos’, ‘Marujos’ and ‘Boiaderos’** are examples of spiritual entities understood to be native to Brazil. They are believed to be of mixed indigenous and African ethnicity. They embody what is known as the **native Brazilian spirits**, called ‘**Encantados**’ which translates to ‘enchanted’.

**Capoeira,** as part of Bahian Traditional Culture has helped, alongside the **Terreiros (Candomblé worship centers)**, to preserve Samba de Roda traditional chants, and playing forms, generally used in a similar way as Candomblé: **The Rhythm that closes ceremonies with joy, celebrating life through percussion, singing, and dancing, embodying Afro-Brazilian and Bahia Traditional culture.**

Vogonaut,"Today is the Day of African Traditions in Brazil - Discover Candomblé, the largest religious and cultural African heritage in Brazil"," 

Candomble is one important and historical part of the Africans Traditions in Brazil, amongst other more syncretic cults such as Umbanda. Candomblé is responsible for the continuity and maintenance of much of present-day African Heritage in Brazil.

Disclaimer: I'm an Afro-Brazilian Musician and Percussionist, based in Salvador. This history is both bound by oral history, as well as scientific and historic studies (there are more sources in Guide, link below).

First off: What is Candomblé?

Candomblé is the name given for a series of Afro-Brazilian religious communities of Bantu, Fon (Gbé), and Yoruba origins. These differentiate themselves from other Afro-Brazilian spiritualities as they access majorly African entities, such as the Órixas, Voduns, and Nkissis, without inserting catholic elements into their rituals.

Spirit and energy in Candomble

Candomblé is not concentrated on immortality or resurrection as the monotheistic religions. There is a life in the Orum where the spirits rest, and can even guide and influence their descendants.

In Candomblé, we go through life and gather Axé, the vital force, which is anywhere in nature. When we pass away, the body gives its energy to the new life, while the spirit passes its journey to make sure that they can give the Axé back to the earth.

Candomblé holy places are called Terreiros, which are formally known as Ilê (House) Axé (Vital energy). The name of the terreiro pictured below is Ilê Axé Oya Ominidê, where Opanije.com professor Junior Pai de Santo is ‘Otum Alabê’, a high-ranking Atabaque player for the Orixas.

In Brazil, differing from Africa, many different entities are being worshipped in the same Terreiro, whereas in Africa there is typically only one per region or city. Also differing from most regions in Africa where only men do divination and are high priests, in Candomblé there are many great Yalorixás, female heads of Terreiros.

In the centuries that followed the embarkment of the first Africans to the Americas, many different ethnic groups were put together in forced labor. They were systematically divided from those of the same language, to avoid communication in African languages, forcing them to speak Portuguese, to avoid their organization.

The Bantu, Jeje, Fon, Yoruba, and Malê were the most common ethnic makeups of the enslaved Africans, most of which arrived in Salvador, then the capital of Brazil.

These African civilizations, represented by their enslaved people, were the base upon which Candomblé religion drew its basis. The Africans, based on oral traditions, kept their knowledge through hidden rituals, chants, and rhythms, that were often of a mixed ethnic base, reflecting the multiple African cultures present in Colonial Brazil.

It is impossible to date when these hidden cults began to take the forms presented in modern Candomblé, but is possible to establish the first three centuries as the period where African culture changed and gave birth to Candomblé as we know it.

Syncretism and Candomblé:

The syncretic aspect of Candomblé, often misunderstood even in Brazil, is because the enslaved Africans were forced to display Christian symbols to their captors. This systematic oppression strongly influenced how the African cults displayed themselves, often masquerading the African Deities for catholic saints, to continue their cults however possible.

Enslaved Africans were thought to be evangelized and Catholic, as it was very important to preserve the appearance of Christianity according to Portuguese oppression.

The Catholic method of praying to saints was used as a way of masquerading the Órixas faith within Portuguese oppression. As an example, Yemanjá, the Sea deity, and mother of most Orixas, was worshiped through Holy Mary figures, while the king of Ketu, Óxossi was worshipped through Saint George. There were even figures covertly concealed inside the sculptures of Catholic saints. This was a way that Catholic saints were connected with Candomblé’s Deities, to avoid persecution and keep the tradition. This is a culture that continued through Umbanda, another Brazilian Afro-Religion, and while individuals from Candomblé still worship Catholic Saints, within most Traditional Candomblé there is no more insertion of any Christian Saints.

The modern insertion of Catholic saints and Christian philosophies is not part of Candomblé. In Brazilian Afro-Religion, it is the Umbanda tradition that kept catholic saints and the figures of Jesus within their Cults.

Candomblé still traditionally preserves respect for the Christian religion, however, the last forms of catholic idols and representations in traditional candomblé are fading, as one of the greatest Yalórixas, the Priestess Mãe Stella de Oxóssi once said:

“Previously when we initiated in Candomblé, and in certain periods of the year, it was traditional to go to the church. After I became responsible for this house, this has stopped, because it is a custom that is not needed anymore, we move on with the times”

TLDR: Candomblé is a set of different creeds from West Africa that established itself through the enslaved people of Brazil, with different deities such as the Yoruba Orixás or the Bantu Nkissi. The religion is responsible for a great part of the present day African heritage in Brazil.

JohnPerera,Isn't the POLICE fit with the description of Terrorist Organization?,"This is a theoretical analysis.

According to Wikipedia, ""Terrorism is, in its broadest sense, **the unlawful use of intentional violence to achieve political aims, especially against civilians.""**

source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism (I refer Wikipedia because it is the most commonly accepted definition based on lots of sources and agreed by a majority of the online citizens)

Let's see what police do:

11. Police always **unlawfully using intentional violence.** Whenever they feel suspicious about you, they come to you and ask your ID even though ""suspicious"" isn't a crime/misdemeanor, and if you are not in a ""stop and identify state"". They don't care about the law, so they act unlawfully and use violence against you.

2. The police is controlled by the politicians. Whatever the top politicians want, the police do it. So the goal of the police is to act under the politicians. So what police **achieve is a political aim** which is fundraising for the state.

3. Police **act against civilians**.

That seems the police is fit with the definition of terrorism. So we can call the police is a terrorist organization. That means every police officer who works for the police, is a TERROIRST!

That is more likely theoretical. But even in practice, think about when a police officer comes to you, do you feel safe or **terrorized** even though you don't have any criminal history? So what should we call him then?",2021-09-16 12:00:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/copwatch/comments/ppbxeb/isnt_the_police_fit_with_the_description_of/,copwatch,False

There was another cat lurking around it, but wasn’t attacking (you can see its shadow in the top right corner). We weren’t sure if it was stray or if it lived in one of the houses near by. The poor kitty followed us for a while until it hid behind a fence. 

We weren’t too sure what to do in this situation. We did try and comfort it but we eventually walked away, but felt really bad. Any suggestions on what you would have done?

arachnid-feline,I was able to send a cat back to his family after being lost for 3 or 4 weeks on Christmas eve,"You can't make this up! 
Saturday night/sunday morning, in the wee hours of the morning it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm a nightwatch on a horse farm and I was walking along the fence looking at my horses when I spotted eyes reflecting back at me from the top of a fence post.
Not entirely abnormal with raccoons and such so I keep walking. I get closer and they don't move and just keep watching. I get closer and start talking asking what it was.
It was cat. He was hunched over, thin coat, shivering with frost on his fur. He was frozen to the top of the post.

I got warm water and got his feet off and took him to one of the barns where the day shift crazy cat lady is. We get him set up in a heated room, food, water and a bed.

We have a microchip scanner for the horses so for fun and giggles she ran it on him the next day. It came up with a number and the ""feline"" code.

The plan was to call animal control when they open the 26 to run the number until somebody on facebook said ""Try Pet Link."" I found a match. His name is Nugget.

I fill out the found form and 45 minutes later I get a phone call from the owner. 

Nugget was strictly an indoor cat that escaped. He was from the next town over, about 5 or so miles away. He had been missing for around 3 weeks... his children have been asking every day since he's been gone if they've found Nugget yet.

I sent him home last night on Christmas eve. Merry Christmas everybody.

I saw the chance, and grabbed the nail trimmers too.

Giving her a hug, and gently holding her paws I trimmed her front paws' nails. I knew she wouldn't let me touch her back paws, but usually she's very iffy about anybody touching her paws. (Honestly, I think one of the reasons is because when she was around a year old I accidentally trimmed one of her nails too short. Don't sorry, I immediately put it in that powder that pet stores sell to stop the bleeding, and she had noticed how bad I felt right away and comforted and forgave me, but I think she still has a fear).

She got a little antsy, but she still allowed me to trim her nails, and then wipe her down with the wipe. She's a fat cat, so she's even more sensitive about people touching her belly, but she still allowed me to wipe her down.",2024-12-25 13:32:44,https://i.redd.it/xzr2yjjxyz8e1.png,cats,True

s0vae,This creature has infiltrated my dreams.,"For context, I'm housesitting my parents' cat overnight, Christmas Eve to Christmas Day. She's crotchety, has a voice like a lifetime smoker with a sinus infection, and I love her to bits. 

This morning I dreamt I was in an IRL house I do not want to be in with IRL people I do not particularly want to see. At some point this little girl I don't know walks up to me and asks, ""Why is the tumble cycle like a party no one wants to be at?""

""Open the door and everyone comes tumbling out."" 

""Out. Out.""

""Ow. Ow. Ow""

""OW. OW. OW. OW. OW.""

By this point her voice is distorted and raspy, rhythmic and startlingly loud.

I wake up and the cat is yelling right by my head, begging to be let out.

Merry Christmas to me, I guess. Good lord. 🙃

I know people just care for their pets but I've seen so many posts of people freaking out because the animal drank a sip of chocolate milk or had a few crumbs of a chocolate cookie. Stop giving yourselves heart attacks and please never induce vomiting on your own. If it was a little, chances are the animal will have a little gas or some symptom but nothing major. If it's a lot, please DO NOT consult reddit and go straight to a vet 🤦‍♀️. If you're that worried even with a little amount, go straight to a vet as well. Redditors are NOT doctors.

Under advice from the vet, I've been told to stop Panda's thyroid medication in preparation for her iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.

However, I would greatly appreciate her not depositing faeces everywhere (my poor mat has been washed twice today).

Is there a way to stop her from having this upset belly?

I'm unsure how he would handle a different environment, know where his litter box is, and the car rides. The thought of leaving him at home though makes me feel really guilty since he is part of the family. He has been a major help in making me feel less lonely. What do I do?

NotHazAtAll,Does my neutered cat want to fuck the new kitten?,"We have an almost two year old boy and about 8-9 months old kitten in our home rn, the little one has joined us last month but she basically grew up in our arms in the backyard playing with our first child so they've known each other before and they have always been good friends.

However, the boy has this habit where we catch him trying to fuck fluffy things like sweaters and such while we're not around even though he's neutered, and he seems to be shy about it.
Now that the kitten is here, him rolling around and being playful with her gets me questioning if he's just calling her to play or ""play""..?

How do I know for sure?

SpeakerMaleficent78,Can past mental health issues prevent me from becoming a Police officer or a sheriff deupty?,"Hey all, so, to get straight into it, I am a 21 year old female that's currently in my last year of college. I've always wanted to have a job in law enforcement, I'm getting a dual bachelor's degree in criminal justice and Homeland Security/emergency management, I'll also have a certificate in crime scene investigation. I worry that my past mental health struggles may effect my chances while applying to jobs.

In the fall of 2021, I was at an extremely low point in my life, I took a handful of tylonel and ended up in the hospital for a week. I was trying to off myself, but immediately after I regretted it and sought out medical help. I was put on a Lexapro prescription after this for about a month, I did not see a therapist because I could not afford it.

When I went home from college for summer break, I finally did see a therapist on the air force base (my dad is retired AF). He diagnosed me with an adjustment disorder.

Then a couple months after the diagnosis and about a year after my attempt. (2022) I went back to the hospital for suicidal ideation, I was only there over night and ended up doing a couple months of therapy (this was in a different state, and there was a therapist I could meet for free at the college I went to). Here, I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and underwent a treatment called brain spotting and after undergoing this treatment, I was deemed mentally well and was able to cease my sessions with no further action needed.

In August of this year (2024), my uncle passed away and it was also an extremely tough time for me as it was sudden. I went and saw a nurse practitioner at a mental health clinic (I don't want to share the name of it for privacy reasons, but it was a place where you could get mental health care 24 hours a day). But this dude ended up diagnosing me with a mood disorder and PTSD as well as stated that I was self harming myself to ease depression and anxiety synptoms, this is not remotely true. 

I only found this out after I pulled my medical record from this place and to say I was pissed is an understatement. I lierally just went in to talk to someone because I was upset about my uncles passing and now I have 3 things that could absolutely screw me over when applying for jobs in law enforcement. (I'm gonna stop here because that whole situation can be it's own reddit post haha). So right now I am seeing a licensed psychiatrist in order to get a confirmed misdiagnosis.

I think I about covered everything regarding my past mental health stuff. I do apologize that this is long, I just wanted to cover everything to get the correct advice.",2024-12-25 03:49:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/police/comments/1hlt4om/can_past_mental_health_issues_prevent_me_from/,police,False

Let's say for American police would you prefer car patrol or foot patrol?  From what I read is if you do foot patrol you are only responsible for around  1.50 miles in the route.

traumarecovery,Hesitant to Call,"Hello,

I am hesitant to call the police because I was made into the bad person in a domestic dispute, but I feel like I have more credence to my story as I have resolved my personal problems yet the culprit who was the actual aggressor continues his behavior.

To make a long story short, I was suffering from PTSD from what was basically rape from a separate incident.  I am also not the type to argue back and forth as a trained teacher, so when the police made accusatory statements or made assumptions to me, I just kept my mouth shut -- again, this is because as a trained teacher, I felt at the time responding would make the situation worse.  For example, I have a BA and was a teacher, but without any knowledge, the police assumed since I was a young girl living at home meant I was not very intelligent and they asked why I don't apply to McDonalds.  What they also didn't know was I was sexually harassed by other teachers at work (one teacher asked, for example, if I was sheltered I don't know what a d\*ldo is), so that's another reason why I didn't want to return and wasn't sure what to do next in my career move.  Anyway, my brother always makes this threatening body language if I defend myself or dispute an accusation (I do also try to understand him, but he takes offense to EVERYTHING), and I realized because the police wasn't listening to me and assumed the worst because I had PTSD, they wouldn't care to listen or believe me.  My brother will turn around and be like, ""What are you gonna do about it?""  It's an intimidation tactic.  He also lived at home at the time, but now he comes every day and gets money from my parents, when I work online as a tutor, gone to therapy, and paying debt so I can get an apartment again -- no one even knows where my brother lives and he has always kept that secret.  He even uses my Mom's extra car because he doesn't have one.  Anyway, I didn't realize how bad my brother is since I haven't lived with him since 9th gradeish, and I never really reported his threatening behavior because I did care about him and wouldn't want to throw him in jail, but it got me in trouble because eventually tapped him on the shoulder and said ""Leave me alone"" and he claimed to the police I battered him and family (parents) before but the police weren't called.  He claimed I threatened him as well.  So the apparent series of incidents that were false led police to think I was being an aggressor.  All the while I did my best to ignore them even when I would stay in my room --my entire family, drama lovers, WANTED a reaction out of me.  Honestly, I was too tired to fight and just accepted guilt, thinking I could fix it later.  My brother was also jealous because I had a career and something going for me, while honestly, he did not.

Well, I have exponentially improved my mental health, and I noticed last night feeling defenseless and helpless as he tried to say, ""Who's been arrested?""  as he pointed a camera to try to use as ""evidence"" should the police come back.  I was helping my Dad with his phone not working on an 800 number, and my brother wanted to make it seem like it was my fault -- tech issues are NOT my fault.  I could feel myself get flustered, and after repeated incidents like this, I did stand up for myself.  So he puffs up his body like, ""what are you gonna do?""

Should I report this to the police?  I definitely don't want to get in trouble, and I realized I often overlooked this small gesture he often used as a power play because it's so quintessential to who he is and no one can ever stop him from acting like that --  not even my Mom and he learned it from my Dad.  Basically the tough guy act.  That's what's triggering me because I feel threatened and I am tired of it.  He WANTS to push my buttons so I tap him or something like that so he can get me arrested AGAIN.  He is trying to take away my good character by making it seem like I am a bad person - I would give more details but this is long enough, and I cannot allow him to intimidate me like this anymore.

Should I call police when they think I am the problem?  I am looking into legal advice with an injunction as well.

UpperNoreenRoad,Corrupt traffic police in Virginia,I was following a heavy truck overloaded with stones from a safe distance on an expressway in Virginia. The truck was dangerously leaning to its left side and I called the police. After reporting the number plate of the overloaded truck I attempted to overtake it. The truck was driving on the middle lane and while I attempted to overtake it a stone fell from the truck and broke my car's front windshield. I flashed lights at the truck driver from behind asking it to stop so we can record the incident. The truck refused and continued driving. I called the police again and described the case and told them I am following the truck and my whereabouts. The Virginia police were not helpful at all and while I followed the truck for many miles I finally decided to let it go and drive to the nearest road police post that is stationed in the middle median of the expressway. After talk to the police I realised they were not going to record the incident and were talking to me with sarcasm as if they were protecting their own truck driver and I was just a tourist a passer by in Virginia. I reported this incident to the Police in the US but nothing happened. Be careful while driving in Virginia!

BluntBastard,The media coming out from NYC in regards to Luigi is ridiculous,"The pictures I’m seeing can only be described as theater. A suspect is being led by what appears to be over 50 officers, some in tactical gear, some in basic uniform, some in suits, and of course let’s not forget the tactical sunglasses. It’s a parade that’s completely overblown and unneeded.

My main complaint is that the difference between the resources invested into the murder of a CEO and the murder of a random person in the same area (pretty much nothing in comparison) is stark, and only seems to highlight the “favoritism” that our current system has for the wealthy. It’s only causing bitterness amongst a portion of the populace. I presume that law enforcement and the media are trying to hype this guy up as a criminal, a threat to society, but in reality the opposite is occurring. He seems to be becoming a martyr of sorts for those who despise the health industry and the political system as a whole.

In short, the theater surrounding Luigi is only reinforcing the resentment that many have and I wouldn’t be surprised if another attempt is made on the life of an affluent individual, especially one connected to health or big business.

a1ivegirl,sublet- stolen money,"i moved into a sublet as a short term thing with the option of it being long term and paid this guy $1200 for the rent and a $650 deposit. yesterday i was woken up to knocking at my door and the landlord was surprised to find me living there. the landlord explained that this guy hadn't paid his own rent in months and that he certainly hadn't paid them the money i paid for my rent for the month. they were actually pretty understanding about things and understood that i had been scammed by him the same way they had and i'm going to be paying them for half the rent this month... i also found out the rent is only like $860 so not only did he steal from me but he also overcharged me. neither i or the landlords know much information about him, i've managed to find a few of his friends names but no family members and i don't know where he's living or working now but i have found a bunch of his past jobs and could potentially message old coworkers. i also have his facebook where it looks like he's selling all his worldly possessions (pieces of junk.)
do i file a police report against him? will the police even help me/get involved or will they even be able to since i don't have his address? the landlords have an open file with the TAL with a court date coming up and have said they can help me open my own/add me into theirs but i'm wondering which of those options would be best, like do i open my own file or add into theirs? or is this more of a small claims court things? i really need someone to point me in the right direction as to what my next steps should be here.

when i had first moved in he actually offered to drop by and help me move a couple of my heavier items into the house and i'm wondering if i should take him up on that offer now since he doesn't know that i know he stole scammed me and pretty much everyone else around him. hell even the neighbours had money stolen from them as well as packages!! i'm a girl and i'm not very intimidating so i doubt that route would work even if i did convince him to come by but i have some big friends who could help me out to try to get him to send me the money back now vs waiting months but i don't really want to nor have i ever done anything sketchy like that.
anyways, where do i go from here? i'd appreciate any input/suggestions

^^ this was my post on the montreal housing subreddit and i received a comment saying i should bait him to show up at my place and then have the police waiting for him. i’m wondering if this would work and im also wondering if this is something the police would even do/be able to do? would he be arrested or what are the possible outcomes? i live in montreal canada!

BanAppeals-NoReply,Firearm possession and proof ,"Hey everyone, looking for an answer on a question I have been looking into. Small disclaimer, whilst this question did come to my mind looking over the recent legal developments in the Luigi Mangione case, it is not limited to the US and if there are any other practical ideas from other countries, feel free to comment below. 

A question I have pondered the last day or so is how one can prove a possession (and use) of a firearm against another person, if there is no DNA-linked evidence (Not only fingerprints, but also no skin, hair and so forth). This broader question came to me after I had heard that, in the US, the majority of cases such as this don’t usually manage to find fingerprints as evidence and there are in fact firearm designs and modifications that are meant to eliminate as much of a possibility of fingerprints being found as possible. 

From the quick research I have conducted I have found some other alternative ways such as (in the case the firearm was used) matching bullets with the firearm used, gunshot residue that might have stayed on the clothes or other objects the perpetrator may have had on/with them or forensic testing that might show clothes or skin burned or damage during an alleged discharge of the firearm itself. There can obviously always be eye-witnesses or possible footage during the commission of the crime itself, but I am more interested in alternative ways if possible.

My questions are the following: 1) What are the alternative pathways, if no DNA evidence is present, to establish a connection and prove a crime like this in court? and 2) For those who might have any experience in this field, is it in fact true that more often than not fingerprints are in fact not found on guns that were used in the commission of a crime?

External-Air-7272,Horrible NYPD interaction in Manhattan NYC a few nights ago,"My night started out at Target at 29th and 2nd.........it was so crowded and the lines were so long that I decided to go to the nearest pharmacy instead. Walgreens was only a few blocks away, so I figured it would be a quick trip. 

When I got there I was in shock to see a shoplifting female running around trying to snatch whatever she could as two members of the staff tried very politely to get her to leave. Once she walked out the door, there were two men who were waiting for her outside and they started making threats to the staff inside.............even going so far as to state that they would come back and follow them on their way home. By this point one of the staff members had been roughed up and his glasses had been knocked off of his head by these individuals. 

One of the staff members called 911 and within a matter of minutes a male and female officer showed up. To say I was horrified by the way the officer interacted with the victim would be an understatement. 

The NYPD male officer was rude, impolite, nasty, condescending (even going so far as to sarcastically state that it did not matter anymore because this specific Walgreens location would be closing soon anyway.............no kidding you epic jackass..........they are closing because of theft, which I am sure you did not care about considering the outstanding job you were doing being an ignorant fool), and he was verbally abusive AF to the young victim.........telling him off, verbally berating him........not giving him a chance to speak or even answer his asinine questions ""who called me!!?????"" and then making fun of the victim as if he were slow or stupid when all he was is badly shaken up, which I imagine a real officer of the law would have understood. 

During this exchange I stood near the victim and was trying to comfort him verbally........I've never been in this store location before and I could see how upset and hurt the victim was.........and I started recording the NYPD officer..........

See, the thing is he did not realize I was a civilian. I was wearing a black coat with the hood pulled up over my head, and a black mask on. It was not until this epic POS saw that I was holding my phone pressed against my chest that he demanded his female counterpart come to me and take my phone so that she ""could send"" a copy of the video I took of the actual shoplifters. I'm no idiot.............he demanded my phone so that I could stop filming him..........and then it got better. 

Once the NYPD officer realized I was filming EVERYTHING, he suddenly became extremely friendly and pleasant. He even told the victim something to the effect of how he knew him from another time when the police were summoned to the same pharmacy (so again, why were you just an epic turd upon entering the pharmacy?), and he even said ""See! I've helped you before"" and all of this lip service was for MY benefit. What a bloody joke. 

Being an officer of the law is a privilege. We live in a city where nobody wants to call the police unless they absolutely have no other choice...........because nobody wants a fool like this one showing up being rude, nasty, impolite, vicious, condescending............when YOU ARE THE VICTIM no less.............. You have to be a first-rate piece of trash to lash out at the victim who is standing there shaking and nervous to begin with...........and then on top of all of that he is a young black man in a city of racist people..................my heart bled for the staff of this location. They are all out of a job in a matter of days (which again, this officer was gloating about at first), and during the holidays no less............and THIS is how you demonstrate your lack humanity, your lack of dignity, your lack of integrity? We are so royally screwed if we have to rely on people like this coward. That is all I wanted to write because just remembering this is making me sad again........and I still have the videos and a video of you too sir..............I have your face and your partner's phone number saved on my phone...............you are a disgrace to the badge you carry.........you are an utter humiliation for the people you supposedly represent.........and I am deeply ashamed of you for you because lord only knows you are incapable of feeling anything yourself, so I am ashamed FOR YOU. This.................thing..............should never be allowed to represent this city.........nor should he have a badge or a gun...............what has the force turned into? A joke? 

Once upon a time being a NYPD officer meant something. We looked up to you guys. We felt proud to be represented by you guys. Now we avoid you like the plague. Cowards like him are the reason why.

Frosty_Secret8611,"Police officers of Reddit, please tell me your most inspiring, heartwarming, and uplifting story when you were on duty","Hello, everyone!

My name is Victor, and I am a writer who recently published a book detailing a deeply personal experience with two incredible female police officers who saved my life. As a blind teenager, I was bullied and humiliated by my classmates to the point where I was ready to end it all. Just when I was about to give up, two amazing officers stepped in, befriended me, and completely changed my life.

This story even made the news, and it inspired me to write my book. After seeing the impact that story had, I’ve decided to write a follow-up book titled:

""Humanity Behind the Badge.""

The goal of this new book is to share heartwarming, heroic, inspiring, or amazing stories about law enforcement that aren’t often told in the news or media. I’m tired of hearing only about incidents of police brutality and the resulting misconception that all law enforcement officers are like that. The truth is, those stories represent only a small portion of the profession. I want to shine a light on the countless heartfelt and heroic actions that officers take every day to educate the public and debunk myths.

Here’s where I need your help!
If you are:

A law enforcement officer with a story about a meaningful or uplifting moment while on duty,

Someone who knows an officer with an incredible story, or

A civilian who’s had a positive encounter with law enforcement,


I would love to hear your story!

Important Details:

I plan to include these stories in my book.

If you’re uncomfortable using your real name, I’m happy to use fictitious names to protect your identity.

Please let me know if you’re okay with me including your story in the book when you share it.


I truly believe these stories need to be told, and I would be honored to include yours in this project. Thank you in advance for helping me bring Humanity Behind the Badge to life!

Looking forward to hearing from you all.

Equal-Organization92,Entrapment ,"Would an undercover officer continually texting a recovering addict to obtain drugs be considered entrapment? Ok so backstory, police received a false anonymous report that an address was selling drugs and from that report they found the tenant but did not contact tenant, police put surveillance on property (well observed property) and saw a visitor sitting in their car smoking a cigarette. From there they obtained visitor’s phone number and began to text visitor who is a recovering addict to obtain drugs. After not at first being pursued the visitor finally agreed to obtain sed drugs not knowing it was an undercover detective. Undercover detective continued to portray themselves as an addict and to get drugs from visitors on 5 occasions until they wanted an amount large enough to pin the visitor with a trafficking charge and 5 sales. Had police not coerced visitors/ recovering addict into selling drugs to an undercover detective visitor would have otherwise not ever sold drugs. A recovering addict saw an opportunity to get high ob someone else’s dime and did what any addict would do although visitor has never sold drugs in their life. This happened in fl btw. I believe this was entrapment, am I mistaken ? Also the last transaction was made into a sting where car was rammed off record with no badge cam footage. Which violated visitor and passengers (including infant under 10m) rights.",2024-12-18 03:17:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/police/comments/1hgshj3/entrapment/,police,False
Historical-Ad-9526,Detective/officer wife help,"She is currently under investigation, she's always been afraid to seek help because of the fear of losing something she spent her life trying to achieve. Her past is beyond the worst I've heard and I am a psych nurse and thought I've heard it all.
I love her to death, but now with the fear of losing her career, I feel like she wants to give up on life even more. 
I suppose the story starts worse. Let's just say her PTSD turned for the worse at home and I had to report it after my biological son saw her hit me. So now she has CPS on her case for getting upset that my son was trying to run outside and tossing him down on the couch in which he fell off and bumped his head (he's 10), then he saw her hit me, pull out a gun because she thought I'd hit her (never have hit anyone in my life), but she had it aimed at the ground. So this is why I called the police while she then had the gun in her mouth because when I called the police she thought she was going to lose everything.

Even harder on her, I'm not currently staying at the house until 2 things happen. My son is no longer afraid to be around her and 2. She can't yell, hit, or pull a gun (no longer have guns in that house, but it's a rule never the less).

I guess what I'm really asking is, what are the chances of charges going through (especially cps since that's apparently a felony, and 2 the family foilence if I drop the charges I never even pressed).

I know I didn't cause this, but I feel guilty since I know she has trauma and I feel like it's my fault she may lose everything.
She has no family, apparently no friends that care, and I feel like I'm the only one trying to help her when I'm trying to focus on my son. I also don't want to throw away a marriage when she's normally amazing, caring, but had a trigger by running into her long term abuser.

Any ex or current officers have any situation similar? What more can I do? She's getting treatment, but it doesn't help when everyone is hounding her for a statement when they may just fire her anyway.",2024-12-18 02:54:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/police/comments/1hgs222/detectiveofficer_wife_help/,police,False

bajablastftw,Need help with EXTREMELY picky eating corgi,"We’ve had our little 10 month old corgi pup for about 3 months, and while things have been mostly fine, the biggest challenge is how picky she has been with her regular eating. 

I have yet to find a consistent way of feeding her. She usually just eats one full meal a day, usually one cup of kibble, but it’s a battle to get her to even start eating. I’ve tried mixing in chicken/rice, fresh food from Farmer’s Dog/Ollie, and even just random food from our fridge as toppers. There are times where I literally end up having to push food into our mouth to get her appetite going. I know I know, probably not a good or healthy idea, but that is the only method that usually ends up working to get her to stimulate her appetite and get her eating the rest of her food. 

There have been a couple occasions when I just try not to do anything but just let the bowl of kibble sit, and she’ll end up not eating anything for 2 days and she ends up throwing up due to the acid buildup of not eating anything.

She’s acclimated well to our home otherwise and she’s generally a happy dog, but her picky eating habits have been driving me insane, as I never thought trying to get a corgi to eat would be a challenge of any sort.

Any tips or sharing of similar experiences would be greatly appreciated, I’m getting desperate and the amount of time trying to figure out her eating has not been good for my mental health lol.",2024-12-24 07:18:11,https://i.redd.it/udgkc417zq8e1.jpeg,corgi,True

themorriganspeaks,My potato gets really aggressive and I don’t know why ,"My Zelda is such a sweet girl about 90% of the time. She has a dog sister and a cat sister and gets along with them very well. 

Ever since she hit 1 year, she’s had this thing about having her feet touched, or having her butt touched (even by accident) - especially while she’s sleeping. Now I don’t go out of my way to torment my dog and wake her up with butt slaps or foot touches but sometimes I need her to move because she’s in my spot in bed etc and she straight up growls at me. Sometimes she snaps and barks loudly, growls, then eventually goes about her business or lays in her kennel (on her own). 

I’m not sure if this is because she’s not yet fixed? Or if this is a typical corgi thing? This is my first corgi and I’ve had her since she was 4 months old. She’s now 1 1/2 and I just want my girl to feel comfortable.

Our system needs to evolve in order to criminalize the de facto crimes of oligarchy, kleptocracy, and social murder.  

Claiming possession of over 100 million dollars in property rights should be defined as the strict liability crime of oligarchy and/or social murder.  

""Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up, turned green, bobbed to the scummy surface of cupidity unlimited, filled with gas, went bang in the noonday sun."" -Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater",2023-06-07 16:44:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/143i9o4/the_de_facto_crimes_of_oligarchy_kleptocracy_and/,occupywallstreet,False

MystiViolet,I am a little worried - selling my crypto,"I have a small fortune in crypto and plan to sell it sometime in 2025. However, I am a little worried, because I read many stories and experiences from other crypto owners that it can be associated with both large financial costs and risks to have these assets converted from one's private ledger to one's bank! 

I hear many stories about closed and frozen accounts on exchanges when crypto is to be converted into dollars or Euros; - I otherwise thought that the entire crypto system was ""invented by Satoshi Nakamoto"" to get rid of banks that had control over one's money and demanded large fees and several days for transactions! It immediately seems as if the crypto exchanges are ruthless in the way they treat many customers with their algorithms; - and that is what worries me! 

I would really like to have converted my crypto fortune in a safe and fast way, without having to exchange them in a backyard of a stranger! So i can make sure that all rules are followed according to documentation and regulations for the local tax authorities. 

I have bought most crypto on Binance, but have not used Binance for many years, so I could well imagine that if I start transferring large sums for conversion or withdrawal to the bank, that it could have unpleasant consequences; - even though I can document my purchases, and that Binance can just look at my history of purchases and transactions on their own exchange. 

I have registered on several exchanges to prepare myself, and I have talked to my bank about my crypto assets and that I am thinking of selling out sometime next year, but I still have a bad feeling for the journey of my fortune to the bank. I would be super happy if anyone would share their own experience with withdrawals and possibly give me some good advice.",2024-12-25 13:04:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hm0duq/i_am_a_little_worried_selling_my_crypto/,Bitcoin,False

PhilMyu,Buying stuff ≠ cashing out,"I see a lot of people that still either have the view that they should hold Bitcoin forever and never spend/sell it and others thinking about the right time to “cash out”.
Another version is the regretful “I had to cash out to cover bills/replace me car…”.

We should start to differentiate between “cashing out” (exchanging Bitcoin for Fiat without any other purpose than having more Fiat than before) and spending Bitcoin to buy necessities or things to “treat ourselves”.

“Cashing out” is the language of gambling where the cash feels “safe” and Bitcoin was the risky temporary bet. 

Think about a world without Fiat and only Bitcoin (the world that Bitcoin is helping us move towards).
Would you say you “cash out”, whenever you buy groceries with Bitcoin? No, you’d just buy stuff. The only difference to today is that we don’t have to temporarily exchange it for another currency that our counterpart prefers (Fiat).

Another fallacy is the view “We should never spend Bitcoin, that’s what Fiat is for!”
The opportunity cost of spending Bitcoin is the same as spending Fiat that you could have exchanged for Bitcoin. As long as you spend and replace, spending Bitcoin for life is fine!

True-Whereas6812,"Merry Christmas Bitcoiners, do not be deluded by hyper-optimists","Hyper-optimist bitcoin maxis like Michael Saylor and Cathie Wood etc are predicting Bitcoin to reach gold market cap parity and even higher within 5-10 years. 

It’s Christmas, but do not be deluded by these Santas. Impressive as the growth of Bitcoin has been in its first 15 years, it is not going to overtake gold in the next 5-10 years.

I am not trying to take the side of that ignorant dinosaur Peter Schiff. He is a fool as all bitcoiners know. 

But gold has been around for 1000s of years and has a special place in the human psyche. Bitcoin won’t eclipse gold. Maybe bitcoin will reach 25-50% of gold market cap in next 5-10 years, and that would be a great achievement. 

So, don’t believe in the prophets who say 0.1 Bitcoin will be enough to retire on. It is not and it will not be.

Even 1 Bitcoin will not be enough. Stack harder. Aim for minimum 3 bitcoins - still not enough to retire, but 3 bitcoins will amount to a decent chunk of change in 5-10 years.

If you want life changing, retirement grade, Bitcoin wealth, you need to stack 10+ bitcoins. Nothing less will do.

Intrepid-Fill-2067,How can I figure out what wallet I used?,"I'm sorry if I sound clueless, I'm not a crypto guy and have absolutely zero knowledge.

In 2012 for a graduation gift, one of my former teachers gifted me a Bitcoin wallet with about 200 dollars on it as a gag, neither of us took it seriously as an investment, the hassle of having to find a way to spend it was supposed to be the gag.

I ended up creating a wallet on a random site and transferring it all over and using a couple BTC to buy a pizza but then forgot about it. I remember originally was going to try trade the remaining balance to a friend in exchange for a gift card but never got around to it. 

 Several years later, the crypto currency boom happens and reminds me that I had a wallet with about a hundred BTC on it. I did some digging and came to the conclusion that it's lost to time since I had no idea where I saved the information

On a whim today I was going through an email I haven't used since high school and found I copy pasted the some of the wallet's information into a draft email to my teacher thanking him

Again I'm not really sure how this all works so I'm censoring it incase so it can't be stolen

One string of letters/characters in the below format which is what I'm guessing is the wallet address

\###A###A-####-###A-AA##-A#####AA####A

Second string of characters in this format which I'm not sure what it is  
\#A##A##A###AA###

and I saved what I assume is a password reset phrase that consists of a bunch of different words and letters.

Is there a way I can figure out what site my wallet belongs to and recover it?

tanwenbrantley,Privacy & Security Concerns: Running Bitcoin Core and/or Node,"I am interested in running a Bitcoin Node but had some questions about the security and privacy of doing so.  



1) Reading the documentation on [Bitcoin.org](http://Bitcoin.org) it states that a static IP address is required.  Yet there are also recommendations to use a VPN and route the connections through TOR.

These things seem to contradict eachother.  If I just run Core or a Node without the Tor/VPN, wouldn't that expose my location and device info to would be hackers attempting to geotrack or target node operators?  

2) Does allowing an incoming connections on port 8333 expose the whole network?

3)There's also a concern with MAC address exposure with router configurations.

for reference: Read the ""Network Configurations"" and ""Enabling Connections"" section 

https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#daemon-peer-info



Would just like clarification on all this, I am not too familiar with networking and it's terminology so apologies if I'm conflating issues.

What are the best practices and which resources are best for more in depth guidance on all this?



Very much appreciated!

nestaa13,VanEck: “The US can reduce its national debt by 35 percent by creating a bitcoin reserve over the next 24 years.”,"VanEck’s estimate assumes that Bitcoin will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent, meaning that Bitcoin will be worth $42.3 million in 2049. If the U.S. government debt increases by 5 percent per year, that would amount to $119.3 trillion in 2049. Sigel and Frankovitz said:

“The reserve could represent an estimated 35 percent of the government’s debt in 2049, offsetting about $42 trillion in liabilities.”
This optimistic scenario from the pair assumed that Bitcoin’s 25 percent compound annual growth would begin at a price of $200,000 in 2025. Bitcoin currently trades for $95,360 and would need to more than double to reach VanEck’s starting point.

If Bitcoin’s price rises to $42.3 million, that would mean it would represent about 18 percent of the world’s total financial assets. This is a huge increase from the current level of 0.22 percent in the current $900 trillion market.",2024-12-24 19:45:48,https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-vaneck-mid-december-bitcoin-chaincheck/,Bitcoin,False

https://youtu.be/_8d-2QVdtag

In a very genial nod to Bitcoin, Cramer asked about the new administration’s plans for crypto and, in his question, drew a comparison to the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve. Will the White House push for something like that?

“Yeah, I think so,” Trump answered. But the rest of his answer really showed an understanding of the cryptocurrency sector’s importance to the global economy in terms of first principles.

That may be the influence of tech engineer and government efficiency advisor Elon Musk, who is famous for saying, “I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.”


Then Trump said something that proves he’s a crypto fundamentalist, not just a headline reader doing what Elon Musk or his son Barron are telling him:

“And we’ve got to produce a tremendous amount of electricity. And you know that,” he explained. “It’s unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have. But we’ll be able to do it.”


The Future History of The 21st Century
Solar panel prices have already fallen on a parabolic trajectory since the 1970s, pacing like Moore’s Law dictates of computer microchip prices. But electricity could become even more abundant and cheap.
Bitcoin is not only new Internet money. It’s also an industry with immediate incentives to develop cheap, abundant, renewable energy production.

Each time the chip race for more efficient Bitcoin miners catches up to the state of the art, the only place left for miners to compete is on electricity costs. They are already poised to race each other for profit against this expense line in their business model.
The possibilities of a smart electrical grid metered by blockchain platforms that are more articulately interchangeable with monetary currencies are scintillating.",2024-12-24 20:35:55,https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/676b16228ef758138365f3c6/,Republican,False

SlagathorMLG,Need help debunking stats.,"So I recently started taking political debates more seriously and though I’ve always been pretty right leaning, I decided to question my beliefs and look up a bunch of stats and I get stuck on these two. I feel that they can be better explained if I wasn’t as politically inept as I am right now.

Obviously I can tell that Biden’s Economy is doing pretty terrible based on just looking around, but how is it that the BLS and the FRED are both showing positive/better than Trump era results?

If possible, could somebody point me to some links to better understand how to measure economies?

baltimore-aureole,"If you were the CEO of Starbucks, how would you respond to the expanding strike?","https://preview.redd.it/gtv6jvo1009e1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=478d582404906d55a567089839a122a5967054a4

***Photo above*** *- do you know how to spell ""ubiquitous""?*  
  
Unions are ecstatic. There are now (possibly, up to) 300 Starbucks locations that have joined the strike. But for context, let’s note that the chain has 33,000 stores, so less than 1% are involved. (see link below)  
  
Before you say “I fail to see the threat”, let’s also note that - like 2008 – corporate America seems to be wandering into failure and bankruptcy. I won’t provide a full list of chains that went BKO or closed this year. There would be hundreds. But a few of the household names include CVS drugs, Walgreens drugs, Red Lobster, The Container Store, Burger King (!), TGI Friday's restaurants, Spirit Airlines, Bed Bath and Beyond, Family Dollar. . .  
  
On the watch list to soon file chapter 11, based on final assessment of Christmas sales: JC Penney, Rite Aid drugs, Footlocker, Lowes . . . If you doubt any of these names are in trouble, then reply below and tell us what Xmas shopping you did at JC Penney or Lowes. The JC Penney closest to my home has 2 entrances blocked, to save money on security guards.  
  
Starbucks isn’t on the imminent bankruptcy list. But I’m not buying their stock on the dip (shares are down 10% over the past week).  
  
How much does a Starbucks barista actually make? $17 an hour (national average). Probably more in Hollywood or Manhattan, less in West Virginia.  
  
What should Starbucks’ new CEO do? Andrew Nicol has only been on the job 3 months, but he DID save his former employer (Chipotle) from bankruptcy after scandals involving entrees made with horsemeat, child labor law violations, and food poisoning. So if Starbucks' strikers have similar grievances, Mr. Nicol may have relevant experience.  
  
But the sad truth is that there are just WAAAY too many Starbucks. 33,000 worldwide. 16,000 in the USA alone. That’s quite a bit more than the number of McDonalds, A place where you can get a burger and fries with your coffee. We have too many burger places also. So, some closures might be in Starbucks future. If their CEO asked consultants for advice, this is probably what he’d hear:  


**Close duplicate stores in shopping malls**. Those malls are dying anyway. If you have 2 stores in a mall, close the one furthest from the entrance.

**Same deal with multiple stores on a city block.** Keep the one closest to the corner.

**Cull underperforming staff**. This might be the easiest. You CAN fire strikers if they have past performance issues. Chronic absenteeism. Substance abuse while on the clock. Fake slip and fall claims. Inventory shrinkage. Cursing out customers.

**Overeducated and overprivileged.** I’d expand the herd culling to include people with college degrees like philosophy, art history, French literature, political science, ethnic studies, social services, and cultural anthropology (my own college minor). People who wasted tens of thousands on useless degrees are among the most disconnected from reality, and least appreciative of their $17 hourly starting salary. Hey folks . . . this is indoor work with no heavy lifting. If baristas insist that they need more money, remind them Amazon is hiring pickers at $22 an hour.

It's painful to admit, but America has too many coffee shops. Idle fast food drive throughs. Dying malls in the suburbs. Even big box stores are on the brink. I went to Best Buy for some last-minute shopping yesterday. They had chain saws and leaf blowers for sale, front and center, next to the $2,500 OLED big screen TVs. Yikes . . . better start looking over your shoulder, Lowes!  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

I've been thinking about it lately and I realized that for poor to poor endangered people the economy is always bad. It feels like people have been fighting to keep their head above water since 2008. Maybe I'm relying on lived experience and just the general vibe I get from others. But I actually think we are misinformed about the state of the economy. Tell me one time in your lived experience anyone in that bracket when you have felt like you personally benefited from the ""boom economy"".

fool49,Apple comes to Google's defense,"According to Reuters: ""Apple (AAPL.O), has asked to participate in Google's upcoming U.S. antitrust trial over online search, saying it cannot rely on Google to defend revenue-sharing agreements that send the iPhone maker billions of dollars each year for making Google the default search engine on its Safari browser.
Apple does not plan to build its own search engine, to compete with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google, whether or not the payments continue, the company's lawyers said in court papers, filed in Washington on Monday. Apple received an estimated $20 billion from its agreement with Google in 2022 alone.""

They are the two most innovative IT companies in USA. Together they have a duopoly in smartphone operating systems. Big tech sticks together, as they come under attack for antitrust violations.

You can't blame Apple for defending a twenty billion dollars revenue stream. And it is very easy to install other browsers, but many of them also use Google Search. The new threat to Google comes from Microsoft, as it has integrated ChatGPT with its search engine. What's the difference, they are all big tech.

Big Tech was created with the help of the authorities. It can also be humbled with the help of the authorities. But Big tech represent a major portion of stock market capitalisation, and gains. The authorities dont want to rock the boat. There is a strong case to break up Google. But Big Tech can't let that happen, because it might be the first domino to fall.

fool49,Ancient Egypt had more equal distribution of land,"I am taking this course on evolution of human rights. Tracing back the beginning of law and human rights, to Egypt and other ancient civilizations There according to law, land was equally distributed between adults and children, males and females. The lecture on this subject did not go into details.

Why do modern countries discriminate explicitly on age, and implicitly on gender? They are both physically weaker. But to serve in the modern knowledge economy, it is your mental abilities that matter, and not your physical abilities. Smart children should be allowed to graduate and work for full pay, as to their mental age, not their physical age. Women still are the caregivers for children, family, elders, etc. And they are underpaid for the work, or not rewarded fairly. 

Set women and children free. Give them economic rights, and land. Teach 12 year olds, life skills, and professional skills, so they can work part time or graduate early, and work full time. Have childcare in all businesses exceeding a certain size, so young mothers can work. And make sure women and children get equal pay for equal work.

>These commodity items are not necessarily rare but China has plenty of them and, more importantly, is nearly the only country which processes them in large quantities. The reason is that the processes to do refine the raw materials are somewhat dirty and only profitable when done on scale.

The important phrase here is ""nearly the only"", another report from 2 weeks ago suggested *only* China provided processing for some of these minerals.  I was ""corrected"" but TBH, I cannot find anything which explains how much of these rare earths is required for manufacture vs how much is actually processed in non-China refineries.

baltimore-aureole,"What happens when wind turbines die of old age? Well, it’s not QUITE as a bad as nuclear reactors, but they're still going to cost “someone” billions","https://preview.redd.it/apopao91hs8e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcc1cfbad7642d51dd6e598a693cb4d4c890b811

***Photo above*** *- unnamed offshore wind farm. 200-foot-long oceangoing tug at lower right shown for scale. After 25 years all these used blades are destined to become artificial reefs. Wait . . . did some worry wart just say ""microplastics are infiltrating the food and water supply""? Can't be - wind turbines are safe, clean unlimited energy, right?*  
  
My father told me that (as a boy) the homes in his community started going all-electric. Because some guy from the electric company showed up and started telling everyone that *""nuclear power will be so cheap we won’t even bother with meters anymore.*” Then. a short while later, the full costs of constructing, operating, and then decommissioning nuclear power plants became apparent.  
  
Are we headed down the same path with wind turbines? Forbes magazine (link below) has captured the scale of the problem but doesn’t pretend to predict the cost.  
  
There are approximately 75,000 wind turbines in the USA. Yeah – that surprised me too. I would have thought that would mean electric power to spare. (one turbine for every 5,000 people?) Well, in any case, their operational life is 20-25 years. But some of these towers date back much further. To 1980, or earlier. Some have already stopped spinning. A few are actually decommissioned. It all depends on how your state and local government define decommissioned. Are the blades removed? The high voltage wires? How about the giant generator on top of the tower – what happened to that? Is the land underneath restored to something else? Farmland? A nature preserve? Replanted forest?  
  
My mom used to live in a town which bragged about having America’s most famous paper mill. It was actually on Paper Mill Road. Beside a scenic stream where the paper oligarchs would dump their toxic waste after making the paper. That mill had been closed for a century by the time she moved there. But the building remained, rusting and collapsing. At one point the corpse of a murder victim was stashed inside. Local politicians finally bit the bullet and decided to remove what remained at taxpayer expense. It took over a decade. A local historic group got involved and insisted on preserving the 75-foot-high brick and stone chimney. Which stood like a towering an eyesore for another decade, before collapsing. Today the entire factory site is a parking lot.  
  
Nobody is going to want a parking lot at the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant, or a wind turbine, if that place used to be a remote cornfield or a prairie. And don’t get me started about decommissioning offshore windmills. Those things cost $2-$4 billion each to construct. Giant ships and cranes and helicopters will again be needed to remove each one of these. At which point the plastic/composite blades will be disposed of by . . . dumping them in the ocean. To form artificial reefs for fish. Because those blades won’t decompose in a landfill, and there aren’t enough landfills for 225,000 ginormous turbine blades (75,000 towers X 3 blades each) anyway.  
  
A similar problem is starting to crop up with solar panels. They don’t live forever either. People with Solar City version 1.0 would like to upgrade to version 2.5, which is more efficient, durable, and might even blend in, rather than a looking like a mosaic of baking trays on the roof. Some solar installers will remove your old panels (at a slight additional charge) if you hire them to install the new improved version. Some won’t. Some other companies will remove them and (safely) recycle/dispose of the old ones, at a not-so-slight additional charge, if you can't sell a house with a non-working solar roof.  
  
There are already companies springing up to recycle EV car batteries. The biggest one was founded by a former Tesla engineer. He saw this opportunity coming a mile away. Some day he may be richer than Musk.  
  
**Back to the turbines**. And nuclear power plants. And failing hydro-electric dams. And every upcoming promise of infinite energy, perpetual motion, or the latest idea to solve all our energy problems. Fusion reactors. Tidal electric turbines. Geothermal (lava) production of steam. Giant mirrors and lenses to turn water into steam. Giant space mirrors to send concentrated solar rays to the concentrated points on earth’s surface. Giant blocks of recycled concrete hoisted on cables, which generate electricity as they slowly descend from their clockwork mechanism. Limitless hydrogen gas from limitless green ammonia. . . .  
  
All of these will be more expensive than the numbers we’re being baited with today. Future ""miracles"" - like past ones - will be constructed with no plan for their inevitable decommissioning. Which will also be far more expensive than we imagine.  
  
I’m NOT saying we should go back to burning wood and coal. But maybe we ought to rethink the idea that we can have unlimited electricity, along with unlimited population, unlimited AI, unlimited Bitcoin mining, etc. An ounce of efficiency might be worth more than a pound of cure.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

fool49,"BYD, like Tesla, exploiting workers to grow their sales and profits","According to Reuters: ""In Brazil, ""slavery-like conditions"" include forced labor, but also covers debt bondage, degrading work conditions, long hours that pose a risk to workers' health and any work that violates human dignity.
The workers had to request permission to leave their lodgings, and at least 107 also had their passports withheld by their employer, said labor inspector Liane Durao, adding that conditions at the work site were dangerous.""

If you avoid businesses that are not ethical or sustainable, you would end up avoiding most of the largest or fastest growing firms in that industrial sector. Therefore the key is not to, not do business with them, but to publicize their unethical or illegal conduct. And use activist groups and investors, to convince the company to act in a more responsible manner.

In addition to training its own smaller models including the latest Phi-4, Microsoft is also working to customize other open-weight models to make 365 Copilot faster and more efficient, the sources added.
The goal is to make it less expensive for Microsoft to run 365 Copilot, and potentially pass along those savings to the end customer, one of the sources said.""

Diversity in suppliers makes the software and company more resilient and robust. Hopefully bringing about reduction in costs and improvements in quality. The AI ecosystem is healthy, with both independent AI startups and big tech companies developing and marketing Generative AI models. Perhaps we also do need more narrow models for certain business domains, or verticals and horizontals. Whatever can increase the speed of the model, while bringing down environmental and financial costs. Benefiting stakeholders, like customers and investors.

Maximum_Ad1451,🧠 Your Brain on Multitasking: The Productivity Illusion That's Costing You Hours,"
We've all been there - juggling multiple tasks, and feeling productive, but are we really? Let's break down the science and psychology behind this common workplace habit.

🎯 Single-Tasking: 
 - Our brains aren't actually multitasking when we think we are - they're rapidly switching between tasks
 - Studies show this task-switching can reduce productivity by up to 40%
 - Single-tasking allows for deeper focus, better memory retention, and higher-quality output

⚠️ The Real Cost of Multitasking:
 - Increased mental fatigue and stress levels
 - Higher error rates and decreased creativity
 - Takes longer to complete individual tasks due to constant context-switching
 - Potential long-term effects on attention span and cognitive capacity

🔄 Enter Parkinson's Law: ""Work expands to fill the time available for its completion""
 - This principle actually reveals why multitasking can be so deceptive. 
 - When we multitask, we unconsciously expand each task's timeline, creating an illusion of productivity while actually extending our working hours.

💡 The Solution? Time-blocking with clear deadlines for single tasks. This approach:
 - Harnesses Parkinson's Law to your advantage
 - Maintains focus and mental energy
 - Reduces decision fatigue
 - Leads to better quality work in less time

🤔 Challenge: Try dedicated single-tasking for one week. Set specific timeframes for each task and resist the urge to switch between projects. Share your experience in the comments!

Metalphysics12,What do theory vs practical learning styles teach us about different brains? ,"As I've gotten older I have noticed more and more how just how differently my father and I process information.

We both get a long great, he's one of my best friends, but I do cringe a little bit at just how incapable he is of conceptualising things. 
He is getting older (85) but he's very healthy and has displayed the below traits his whole life.

I'm curious as to what the followimg traits might be an indicator of? 
I'd like to understand my dad better and help him to understand himself better. He is currently trying to learn a new skill and is struggling to keep up with the concepts (on the zoom classes)

Okay here are the traits (the positive ones are at the end)

Traits that demonstrate his struggle:

- Struggles to abstract sounds from words and ooften relies on phonetic pronunciations without realising it.

- Struggles with keeping up with theoretical conversations whether it's basic legal, medical or philosophical conversations and will often revert to common tropes that he is familiar with in order to feel that he is a part of the conversation rather than formulating and articulating ideas in real time.

- Often closes his eyes while trying to talk since it's hard for him to keep what he is trying to say in his mind and speak at the same time

- Relies on people to endure his 'word salad lectures' in order to feel that he is a part of the conversation 

- Very forgetful and often loose things, forget names, make up names etc 

- Has very little interest in being 'accurate"" conceptually. Just today he was talking his 'scoliosis' on his knee.
I asked ""isn't scoliosis a spinal thing?"" After which he started talking about arthritis and inflammation. 
I eventually circled back and said ""oh I see, it says here scoliosis is definitely a spinal thing, but are you saying that scoliosis is affecting your knee?"" He then replied ""yes! Exactly"". (Turns out it was Schumann's disease not scoliosis 😅). 
Side note; he has been dealing with these same issues for 30 years with his Osteopath, so he should have learned this by now. He also often refers to his Osteo as his chiro, even though he often talks about how much better an Osteo is than a Chiro).

- Struggles with discernment and is easily misled by others.

- Struggles with technology (not just through lack of experience, but with basic interpretation of signals. For example if the computer asks ""are you sure you want to replace the existing file"" this may take me 30 mins to explain.
I find that I have to 'personify' computers to explain. ""The computer is just trying to be considerate. It wants to give you a choice, make a new file with the changes, or simply update the current file"" he typically will say something like ""but I already made the changes?"" And on it goes 🤪




Positives (strengtns, abilities and processing styles)

- Very practical person that is able to come up with solutions in a very ""boot's on the ground"" kind of way - his professions have included: Graphic artist (before computers), underwater photographer, gardener (built aborate garden scapes and a rockwall/water feature for our pool from scratch)

- Told me story once about when he did a diving course and struggled with the theory but as soon as he got in the water he knew what to do whilst all the 'academics' of the group were struggling to apply the theory.

- Incredible at visual art 

- Very practical in terms of implementation. In contrast I will often get lost in abstract ideas like what we should for Christmas day and he will just ground it and keep it simple.

If you have read this far, thank you for being a part of my attempts to solve the enigma that is my dad. I do have my own theory; such as that he is simply an artistic person with SCT/CDS but I would love for any other ideas.",2024-12-21 12:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1hj9c44/what_do_theory_vs_practical_learning_styles_teach/,education,False
Very_driven_alpaca,Which is more beneficial for college applications in US: attend a good school but achieve lower grades vs attend less than mediocre school to achieve higher grades?,"Need advice for finding the right highscool that can lead to better chance of getting into college.

They live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
I only attend schools in Australia and thus don’t have any idea about which method is better because we have ATAR(score ranking at the end of year 12 for college applications). Personally I chose to go to a very competitive school so that I get to study harder, even though this means that I won’t be the top in every subject.

Personal_Antelope_35,Esl help for 2nd grader,"Hi everyone! I'm creating this post in hope to get some guidance on how to help my kid improve her comprehension skills.
We speak another language at home, the language doesn't have any words that are common in English and our native language. So my kid started school at the age of 3 and didn't go well at first, she basically resisted learning English for the first 8 months of the school year. 

She is now 7.5yo. Our teachers are oblivious to the fact that she fools them into thinking she understands everything. She has been very successful in pretending that she is simply not interested in a topic while she most likely doesn't have the vocabulary to understand what it is about. So this is the first year when her teachers finally told me that her comprehension is behind her other skills. She reads and writes above her grade level but comprehension is within the grade level.

She doesn't switch to English when she is home, she prefers her native language books and cartoons. She rarely speaks English to us.

I'm trying to teach her more words, we have some materials to learn new words. But I feel it's not what she needs. She needs to practice her comprehension skills and not just learn words.
Is there a program that is engaging and not boring, where she can read something that is appropriate for her developmental stage and actually improve her comprehension and vocabulary? Everything I see online is either too far behind her developmental level or too boring and requires me standing over her as a policemen. Am I missing something?

SoylentRox,Competency based education: why doesn't it already work that way?,"https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2024/12/competency-based-education/

This immediately comes to mind a model for doing this.  Classes are held but the teacher acts more like a TA, answering questions and giving students 1:1 time.  There are no homeworks and no midterms, instead you can take exams at the testing center, available every day(testing center is a room where you have to give up any devices and take the exam while proctored).  Similarly classes are available year round, with different teachers staffing the center for this subject.  

Fail an exam and you perhaps have a delay before taking it again (and it's a random draw from a question bank or something), but it doesn't slap your transcript with F/C/B and harm your chances in the future.  

Finacial aid etc require some minimum rate of completion of credits (passing exams) but if you can afford it you can take any length of time.  

Is the model we have just an accident of history?  Why doesn't it already work like this?",2024-12-18 22:11:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1hhda86/competency_based_education_why_doesnt_it_already/,education,False
Dodgers93,"A very useful Spelling App, you got to try 👀","
For any parents or teachers looking for a good good spelling app, please download and try Spelliful. If you try I’m always open to new features and improvements.  

Spelliful is a weekly spelling / vocabulary word app. Easily create a list to add your own words and attach audio, video or image to each word. Group your list by students or kids names. Do a spelling unscramble activity or take test, both providing your audio video or image as hints if needed. Don’t want to record your voice then use the system voice instead. Voice is needed for testing, however for hearing impaired mode, the image or video provided is used. Very useful for sign language videos. 

Spelliful is fully functional and free to the learning users, (kids and students). You can, as the adult, take advantage of the premium feature of uploading list with all media attached to words and distributing via a generated code. This feature is for purchase but isn’t necessary for the average user. If you’re a teacher and you easily want mass distribution it’s very useful. Uploading and sharing is found in the Teacher’s Desk portion of the app. 


You can search Spelliful in the iOS AppStore but I provided a link below.

Context, this week is our finals week, with Monday and Tuesday being our preparation days (pretty much normal class) and Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are our testing days (Wednesday has 1-2 period testing, Thursday has 3-4 period testing, and Friday has 5-6 period testing). My AP world history teacher wanted to have a ""cultural food day"" on our testing day instead of actually doing the test, meaning the test was moved up. The test was an hour long DBQ question.
My issue is that, because she moved the test was moved to today (tuesday), and our class periods are less than an hour, she cut everyone's tests almost 15 minutes short.
I understand that she wanted to have the cultural food day on Thursday, but I am honestly really upset about losing almost a fourth of my alloted time on the test in AP classroom; I felt confident about my performance at first, but I did really need those extra 15 minutes, and I ended up with very large significant parts of my DBQ just not having been written.
What do I do?

saltlemon,I don't want to send my daughter to school uk,"My daughter is 4, she will be starting school next September. She has developmental delay, she has only just starting putting words together a little and most of them aren't clear. She can't have a conversation back and forth, she's probably at the stage a 2 year old is with communication. 

She also has some birth defects, she has a double thumb and no enamel on her teeth so her teeth look brown and bumpy even though we brush twice a day which she is brilliant with. Some children have asked her if she doesn't brush her teeth or why her teeth are moldy looking and brown and she can't respond or understand why, I try to explain to her but it's like she isn't understanding. It breaks my heart on levels I can't explain and her thumb, people asking why her thumb is like that or ew. (I didn't have her thumb removed when she was little because she had major heart concerns so it was at the bottom of our list, then we decided whilst she can't make her own decisions we didn't want to put her at risk of anything happening with anesthesia for something cosmetic).

I just really really don't want to send her to school. I feel like I'm putting her out there to get bullied and she is so loving which makes it harder. She started walking at age 3 and has a tight calf so she doesn't have great balance still and can't pull her trousers down to toilet so I also really don't want a stranger doing that for her, especially when she can't communicate or tell me if something happens. She isn't great with eating or drinking I have to prompt her to eat or drink as she gets bored after a few bites. 

I have thought about homeschooling but I honestly don't know if I have it in me, I could do it for a few years but if the plan is to eventually send her to school I would need to be fully on it teaching her the full curriculum. 

I wish there was an in-between school like a part time one even one parents could attend or one that was more free flow and creative, growing the child instead of heavy focus on grades etc. because I already don't like the current education system, it didn't do anything for me either, I think all I left school with was no self confidence.

MantaRay2256,Please speak up and stop Trump from raiding schools for undocumented people!  Please contact your Congress members.,"Trump wants to repeal the provision that law enforcement cannot remove undocumented persons from school campuses.  

Can you imagine the trauma of witnessing parents ripped away from their kids as they drop them off at school?  Or as law enforcement rounds up beloved school staff?

I taught at a VERY conservative rural school twenty plus years ago.  It was surrounded by dairies and almond orchards that depended upon undocumented workers for labor.  When the young mother of two students, a K and 2nd grader, was on the verge of deportation (she received a letter with a date to report to ICE), the community united to keep her in the community.  They chipped in for a good lawyer, wrote letters, and called their representatives.  We held a fundraiser in the school gym.  And we prevailed.

I'm utterly positive that nearly every one of those families voted for Trump - even though they must remember just how invested we all were in keeping that mother with her family.  I don't understand how that happens, but memories are a funny thing.  

At least we knew we wouldn't witness her arrest at the school as she dropped off her kids.  If I had, I would have probably quit as a teacher on the spot.

Impressive_Returns,For those of you who may not remember December 7 was the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  December 14 was the sneak attack and mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school.,"Teaches sacrificed their lives so children could live.  Gunman took the lives of 20 students, 6 teachers/staff members plus his mother and himself.

If’s been 10 years and gun lobbyist, politicians have failed to enact stiffer gun control laws to protect students, teachers and staff.  How many other mass shorings has there been since Sandy Hook?  

Take a moment to remember the 20 students who lost their lives as well as the 6 teachers and staff members.

Then spit at Alex Jones for creating and spreading the conspiracy the whole thing was staged. And spit on him agin for the years he and his followers tormented the parents who lost a child to the gunman saying they were actors and the whole thing was staged.

This is a disgusting result of our higher education and associated access to credit. Select the correct answer below.

a) the institutions responsible for education produce such a large output that cannot monetize the skill set they gained making them unable to pay the loans back

b) borrowers blindly gave them loans without qualifying their credit worthiness on any objective metric to repay the debt and subsidized political agendas and indoctrination programs that they were never going to be able to be monetize

c) our education system produced GRADUATES that are too dumb to understand their debt obligation

Wazzi_Yota,Descendants of US slavery Diaspora and Tribes/Ethnic Groups,"1. African-American-#ADOS (Formerly known as Freedmen)

The term “African-American” is the name of ethnicity of people who are descendants of enslaved Africans who were enslaved within the United States. Elon Musk is not an AA, your ancestors have to be enslaved in the U.S to be an AA.

We’re probably the largest ethnic group in our diaspora. We’ve created the most emulated culture. 

2. Louisiana-Creole (African-American sub-ethnicity)

People descended from the inhabitants of colonial Louisiana before it became a part of the U.S. during the period of both French and Spanish rule. Louisiana-Creole People can be any race. Black Creoles are descendants of slavery as well.

Just like African-Americans, Creole people are very inclusive! They have the best cuisine in America

3. Congau-People (Formerly known as Americo-Liberians)

A Liberian ethnic group of African-American descent.

Historically, African-Americans always had a close connection with them, but in modern times, we have little to no connection at all with the Americo-Liberians.

African-Americans who couldn’t afford the trip to Liberia created two communities in America named after the country they couldn’t go to. “Liberia, North Carolina” “Liberia, South Carolina” 🇱🇷

I have to visit their Republic (Liberia) before I die.

4. Gullah-Geechee (African-American sub-ethnicity)

The Gullah-Geechee are African Americans who live in the Lowcountry region of the U.S. states of Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, in both the coastal plain and the Sea Islands.

The Gullah Geechee people have a culture that differs from Main-stream African Americans. They’re unique, because they’re arguably the most African people in our diaspora. They speak an English dialect called “Gullah” that has retained many African Words. Their culture has significant African Influence, generally speaking.

5. Black-Nova Scotians

Black Nova Scotians are Black Canadians whose ancestors primarily date back to the Colonial United States as enslaved people or freemen, and later arrived in Nova Scotia, Canada during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

6. Merikins 

The Merikins were African-American Marines of the War of 1812 – former African slaves who fought for the British against the US in the Corps of Colonial Marines and then, after post-war service in Bermuda, were established as a community in the south of Trinidad in 1815–16.

Battle of Bamber Bridge  
Jun 24, 1943 – Jun 25, 1943

https://preview.redd.it/2sizf6u2m7971.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=cee13f3ee17e8c3624aa9ee812c9e745cf6e0321

On this day in 1943 black American soldiers faced off with white American Military police during World War II on British soil. Yes you read correctly black American soldiers had to fight their own white American soldiers, while in England, where they were fighting for the world.

Why? Because the English town of Bamber Bridge in Lancashire was not segregated so they treated the black soldiers like all other races, aka blacks were free to eat, drink anywhere, BUT back in America segregation of blacks and whites still existed. So essentially the American army went to someone else’s country and demanded they adopted America’s racist practices

So when the American Military police found out that their own black American soldiers were drinking at the same pubs as white people they went in to arrest them. The people in the town got mad about the treatment of the black soldiers and decided to then turn their pubs into “BLACKS ONLY DRINKING PUBS” the very opposite of what was taking place in America with their WHITES ONLY businesses.

Of course this pissed off the American military so guns went blazing, and when word spread back at camp that black soldiers had been shot, scores of men formed a crowd, some carrying rifles and by midnight more American military police arrived with a machine gun-equipped vehicle, so the black soldiers had no choice but to get rifles from British stores while others barricaded themselves back on base, so now it was American white soldiers versus American black soldiers. This lead to the death of one soldier, injury of 7, and 32 convictions.

Back in America, the battle was hushed up because they didn’t want the country to find out that they were fighting their own soldiers which would anger the black population and weaken the morale in the country.

ickda,I find the juneteenth to be dishonest.,"Want to hear your take, but I find it rather dishonest that it is the so-called celebration of the end of slavery. 

When it truly did not end the oppression till after Mr king and X got assassinated, and rosa parks fought for her equality. 

 Like were you truly freed after the maculation proclamation? Is 100 years of war, murder, lynching, and massacres really freedom?


I don't know, I feel like the holiday is just more propaganda for others to say things like, but slavery was so long ago, why don't they just get over it.

 When the oppression really did not end till around the 1960s, and honestly even then, it feels and looks more tolken than anything.

deleted,"Some people pose the question of ""Why impeach Donald Trump"" with only days left in office?"" Well I'll TELL you why.","I am struggling to hold back the barrage of curse words that I really want to use in this post, but I don't want to the moderator to bust me, so I'll have to settle for inferences. So check it out... news sources say Mitch (first letter should be a ""B"") McConnell is throwing cold water on the idea of impeaching Donald Trump for inciting the January 6th insurrection and assault on the U.S. Capitol by the band of racists, militia idiots and Civil War psychos more commonly known as Trump supporters. Well screw Mitch McConnell, and I can't wait until this sorry #$%@& is MINORITY leader... and it will be even better when the day comes that he gets voted out of office period!

Like many people, I would hate to see the early days of Joe Biden's administration wrapped up in impeaching the Insurrectionist-In-Chief, but it has to be done for matters of Constitution, Democracy and precedent!

We, as Black people, must also remember to ask ourselves this question:

What more can we expect from a man whose own father, whose name is Fred Trump, was arrested at a damn KKK rally?!!! I say fry Trump's butt like a barnyard chicken, and BAR him from ever running for President AGAIN!

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/28/in-1927-donald-trumps-father-was-arrested-after-a-klan-riot-in-queens/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/28/in-1927-donald-trumps-father-was-arrested-after-a-klan-riot-in-queens/)

Police reports and records do not identify the elder Trump as an actual KKK *'supporter', s*o let's get THAT comeback out of the way, but I'm ol' school, and the question remains *""then what the hell were you doing there?!!""* It's enough that Fred Trump AND his dumb-A son both have a record of racial discrimination with respect to renting to Black people, and in my opinion, he therefore remains suspect in terms of supporting the KKK. There's no question in my mind that Donald Trump *was raised on racism*, and man does it show!

cdnhistorystudent,Women displaced by the war face an ever-worsening health crisis in Lebanon,"> For the more than half a million women and girls in Lebanon who have been forced to flee their homes under Israeli bombardment, the difficulties they already faced accessing reproductive healthcare and essential hygiene products have reached a fever pitch. “The displacement has had a huge impact on women, especially those who are pregnant,” said Dr Karam Choucrallah Karam, Professor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the American University of Beirut (AUB). Healthcare practitioners like Karam are particularly concerned for pregnant women who have fled to shelters. External stress can worsen a pregnant woman’s state and severely impact her health.

> The university’s medical center, AUBMC, has seen a surge in patients seeking help since they launched a program offering free, weekly reproductive health checkups for displaced women last Saturday. Many of the pregnant women among those coming for treatment have been unable to see their family doctors since they were forced to flee their homes and have likely missed important checkups. Prenatal doctor appointments are recommended monthly earlier on in a pregnancy, increasing to weekly toward the third trimester. “They come to us for prenatal care, but we’re also seeing a range of other issues like depression, anxiety, and panic attacks — conditions that are exacerbated by the poor living arrangements they’re enduring,” says Karam.",2024-11-15 06:40:33,https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1435350/women-displaced-by-the-war-face-an-ever-worsening-health-crisis-in-lebanon.html,humanrights,False

chromatikat,Please Help NZ Abuse in Care Victims Achieve Relief,"I have been fighting for my husband to join me in the US. Due to his upbringing in care, he is being punished for crimes he committed as a result of how he was raised and neglected, and he cannot sponsor me to his country as a result. He has since rehabilitated, but is still denied living a normal life and continues to be judged harshly by strangers. He has needed to work significantly harder to obtain a piece of a normal life that he was denied by the government's inaction.

He is only one of over 200,000+ victims that have regretfully made poor decisions in youth upon aging out of state care. The victims want to move forward in life and stop reliving their trauma as prisoners depending on the government to survive, now trapped in poverty. The survivors want to be a part of their community and economy, but instead are ostracized and being held down by inept regulations set by a society without empathy, for holding convictions due to their reaction to the abuse, and the chronic inaction of their own government that has worked to hide this horrific mistake of theirs for decades, until now. 

As of today, the government is moving at a shamefully slow pace, barely responding to the claims of victims from over 20 years ago. The survivors need justice NOW.

Please sign, spread the word, and help the victims have their voices heard in the upcoming apology so that action can be taken in helping them move on to heal and be able to pursue a normal life that they have wrongfully been denied.",2024-11-07 17:50:04,https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/implement-all-recommendations-from-the-abuse-in-care-royal-commission-of-inquiry,humanrights,False

Truth-or-Death1988,What Will Happen to the Kings of the Earth?,"*We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. - I Corinthians 2:6*

*No light from a lamp will ever be seen in you again. No voices of bride and groom will ever be heard in you again. Because your merchants were the great ones of the world, all nations were led astray by your magic potion. - Revelation 18:23*

*And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” - Revelation 6:15-17*

*Then shall the kings and the mighty perish*

*And be given into the hands of the righteous and holy. - Enoch 38:5*

*At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: “O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike. - Matthew 11:25*

*For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence. - I Corinthians 1:26-29*

Truth-or-Death1988,"Understanding God’s Plan to Refine Us, the Lukewarm/End Times Church","*“Wise leaders will give instruction to many, but these teachers will die by fire and sword, or they will be jailed and robbed. During these persecutions, little help will arrive, and many who join them will not be sincere. And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way,* ***they will be refined and cleansed and made pure*** *until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come. - Daniel 11:35*

So, this is the refining fire that scripture alludes to in so many passages. And we can see here its purpose as well, which in no way deviates from Romans 8:28, as we can see that its purpose is to refine us and make us pure.

But let me ask you: What would you do if you woke up to find that not only have you not been ""raptured,"" but even the godliest man you know was due to be beheaded soon? Would you be so far deceived by false teachings that you would throw out the whole Bible, believing it all a lie? Or would you endure to the end to be saved?

And are you aware that in every country in which these current conflicts are popping up, Christian persecution has seen a sharp increase? You may be surprised at what you find if you do a little digging. But if you have already come to understand what Daniel was saying, and how it perfectly mirrors Revelation 13:7, then certainly you are not too surprised.

***It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them.***

*And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. - Revelation 13:7*

And here in the US, it has been reported that the feds have started tracking purchases that include Bibles. Now why would they do that? They're doing that for the same reason they've been doing a lot of things, to prepare the way for the beast to rule over the earth, and he doesn't want any pesky Christians playing watchman and warning the people of this world about the great snare that is being set before them.

We will all have a very important choice to make soon: Whom shall we serve?

The reward for remaining faithful to Christ is beyond our comprehension:

*And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years. - Revelation 20:4-6*

The reward for choosing this world over Jesus will be equally great in measure, but much more terrible than good:

*Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”*

*Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.*

*Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ”*

*“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.” - Revelation 14:9-13*

May Christ be with you all and help you patiently endure the war against God's saints.

Embracing Netanyahu does not constitute a foreign policy 

It is extremely difficult to discern what might be the thinking behind the clueless President Joe Biden and his Blinken-Austin-Mayorkas foreign-policy-plus national security team. Or rather, the problem is that there does not appear to be any thinking about it at all if one measures it by what benefits it brings to the American people. It all actually seems to derive from a desire to construct a narrative that will win the presidential election coming up in November, which will fortunately be run against a deeply flawed GOP candidate named Donald J. Trump. But look at what is on the Biden record: the country’s southern border with Mexico is a porous as a Swiss cheese, allowing literally millions of illegal immigrants into the USA since Biden took office; Washington is both *de facto* and *de jure* simultaneously fighting and losing two unnecessary wars involving nuclear powers which has cost a nearly bankrupt Treasury well into the hundreds of billions of dollars; and the White House is needlessly sanctioning non-hostile competitors like China while also making illegal popular social media sites like TikTok which have committed the sin of reporting and disseminating accurate narratives about good old “best friend and closest ally” Israel. Predictably, neither of the assertions about the value of the Jewish state is true, nor is it a democracy, but who cares when you’re having fun shooting people and spending someone else’s money?

Oh, and just try to exercise your first amendment free speech rights by demonstrating against Israel’s slaughter of upwards of 40,000 Palestinian civilians using US provided weapons and you will be hit on the head by a cop, possibly arrested, and even expelled from college! If you want to see where this is all going, check out reports of the recent FBI [detention and interrogation](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/5/16/headlines/israeli_historian_ilan_pappe_interrogated_by_us_agents_at_detroit_airport) of distinguished Israeli historian Ilan Pappe seeking to enter the US through the Detroit International Airport. Pappe is a critic of the Netanyahu government and of US policy so he was held, questioned in detailed about his contacts, and had his phone copied before being allowed to proceed. Meanwhile, a group of top federal judges have signed a letter stating that they will strike back against the demonstrating students by [refusing to hire](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/columbia-law-backs-its-graduates-after-conservative-judges-said-they-won-t-hire-them/ar-BB1lZTgh) any graduates of Columbia University Law School as law clerks. And there even is a bill currently before Congress that would [empower the government](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/republican-bill-calls-for-antisemites-to-be-deported/ar-BB1m25Bm) to label the foreign protesters “antisemites and terrorism supporters” and deport them, with some going to Gaza with the expectation that they would be killed, possibly by the mighty Israel Defense Forces (IDF)! It would be a startling new development to punish those whose crime consists mostly of trespass even given the rather loose ethical boundaries established by the war on terror and the Antisemitism Awareness Act! Or indeed one might follow the Senatorial route led by a chirping Lindsey Graham who recommends dropping [a nuclear bomb](https://www.newsweek.com/lindsey-grahams-nuclear-bombs-tantrum-sparks-backlash-1899668) on Gaza to kill everyone who has survived the Israeli onslaught. The area then might be developed after the radiation dies down for those splendid seaside villas for Jews only suggested by the esteemed Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

To be sure, Joe sometimes mumbles something that might just be viewed positively, like his recent blocking on humanitarian grounds of a consignment of bunker buster bombs on their way to Israel due to Benjamin Netanyahu’s insistence that, no matter what, he would invade Rafah to completely destroy Hamas and whoever else might happen to get in his way. Joe predictably reversed that decision last Tuesday, approving a $1 billion supply of munitions after he came under pressure from the Israelis and their many friends in the US, to include a host of Israel-loving GOP congressmen who have carried their fight on behalf of the Jewish state to The Hague, where the International Criminal Court (ICC) is being directly threatened with American wrath lest it try to punish Israeli leaders for their genocide in Gaza. As Bill Astore put it “Last week, President Biden appeared to have strapped on a [temporary spine](https://substack.com/redirect/0164c5e8-e48f-433d-8c2d-897c97d47d75?j=eyJ1IjoiM2FydnAifQ.CjSQnuBczHCy1BFS9fzFEtIoBnIxDO9eO0lGKOKHBh0) in delaying shipments of ‘offensive’ weaponry to Israel for its murderous invasion of Rafah in Gaza. That spine had a short duration as Biden announced \[Tuesday\] renewed shipments of tank and mortar rounds to Israel.” Congress has also gotten into the game with the GOP controlled House of Representatives having [passed a bill](https://news.antiwar.com/2024/05/16/house-passes-bill-that-would-force-biden-to-give-paused-bomb-shipment-to-israel/) that would compel the White House to continue all arms shipments to Israel. Joe might also be thinking of political contributions, as American Jews donate the majority of Democratic Party funding, as well guaranteeing a friendly media in his campaign as they dominate both the news and the entertainment industries. See, Joe can figure some things out all by himself every once in a while!

Here’s the problem with Joe, apart from the roughly $12 million in gift-donations from Jewish/Israeli sources that he has obtained in his political career. His tactical thinking does not extend beyond his personal interests, to include his corrupt children, a trait very much like that which is possessed by his good buddy Netanyahu who is facing corruption charges of his own in Israel. Joe believes he is much cleverer than he actually is and thinks that an occasional mild verbal criticism of the Israeli behavior will convince his target audience of voters that he really is concerned about the continuing death toll in Gaza, where the Israelis have already been taking initial steps in their attack on Rafah by using their tanks to penetrate into the targeted zone to destroy and kill.

And as for the [reported completion](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-military-starts-delivering-aid-072642212.html) and initial functioning of the floating pier connected to Gaza constructed by US military engineers, it will not dramatically change reality on the ground even though Biden is claiming that it will enable the entry of much needed food and medical aid. Israel will still “security” control what is allowed to enter into Gaza proper while Netanyahu is seeing the pier as a bridge to nowhere, usable primarily to export excess Palestinians to foreign lands that are either willing or unwilling to accept them. And its existence creates some interesting possibilities. As it presumably will be logistically supported on the pier itself by US-based personnel, Netanyahu might well be tempted to stage a false flag attack blamed on Hamas to kill a few Americans and lock Biden into Israel’s right-wing Gaza policies from now on. Bear in mind that, in reality, Biden could care less if all the Palestinians might be “disappeared” just as he would like to see any and all critics of Israel be subjected to the harshest punishments, including prison and denial of basic rights as well as being stripped of government benefits. He has called the protesters “lawbreakers” and spreaders of “chaos” and congress is currently investigating the alleged “subversive organizers” of the “anti-Israel terrorists.”

Biden and company, as well as Trump, who is advising the Israeli government to “finish the job” with the Palestinians, clearly have no actual red lines that must not be crossed when it comes to Israel. The war of extermination of the Gazans has been accompanied by a more hidden war being conducted by the Jewish settlers on the West Bank, which has been largely under Israeli occupation since 1967. The frequently armed settlers have been attacking unarmed Palestinians, destroying their homes and businesses, ruining their crops and vineyards, and even killing them on occasion. Israeli police and army standing by do nothing to stop the fun and even frequently participate themselves by arresting and beating Palestinians who are guilty only of being Palestinian. Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested without charges apart from “preventive detention” since the troubles began in October and the jails are overflowing. The clear intention, verbalized without any shame by senior Israeli government officials like Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, is to produce a Greater Israel cleansed of Arabs. And Biden, who pretends to favor a two-state solution to the unrest, helps the process along by vetoing UN resolutions that would help create separate sovereignty for Palestine.

Some of the most outrageous recent developments have been the settlers’ [interfering with shipments](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/israeli-settlers-attack-aid-convoy-98-trucks-heading-gaza-jordan#:~:text=Last%20Tuesday%2C%20dozens%20of%20far-right%20Israelis%20blocked%20the,people%20were%20arrested%20in%20connection%20with%20the%20incident) of food and medicines entering into Gaza, a point that a faux-sympathetic Biden stresses repeatedly when pontificating regarding bringing aid to the starving people who are trapped with nowhere to go inside the enclave. The Israel clampdown even includes the Mediterranean Sea being blocked off by the Israeli navy which shoots any desperate Gazans who try to go close to the water so they can fish for food. In the most recent incidents, observed by the standing-by but inert Israeli army and police, truckloads of food were blocked, the drivers and aid workers removed and beaten, and the food was destroyed and burned before the trucks were treated likewise. In another incident settlers dumped huge boulders on one of the access roads to a checkpoint leading into Gaza, rendering it impassible and blocking any aid. Journalists and aid workers are meanwhile being killed by the army to prevent any reporting of what is going on while the US State Department refuses to condemn the activity. Biden called the interference with assistance convoys “outrageous” but has done nothing whatsoever about it, nor has he followed up on pledges to sanction Israelis who attack Palestinians or their property on the West Bank.

The whole problem is that Israel is a monster, an apartheid state that somehow feels it is empowered by God and the United States to kill all its neighbors and rob the American taxpayer to pay for and equip the slaughter. Israel is backed by an all-powerful US domestic lobby that includes unlimited Jewish money and activist Zionist groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) led by the hideous Jonathan Greenblatt and the venerable American Israel Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which are now busy raising money to defeat all congress critters who have ever criticized the Jewish state. ADL and AIPAC are also linked to “that old time religion” knucklehead Christian Zionists concentrated in the Republican Party who have their Scofield Bibles firmly embedded between their ears where their brains are supposed be. A partial solution would be to make the Jewish-Zionist groups register as foreign government agents directed by Israel under the the terms of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which is exactly what they are, but that will never happen. President John F. Kennedy tried to register the predecessor group to AIPAC and many believe he paid the ultimate price for that affront as well as for his bid to stop Israel’s nuclear weapons program.

So, my fellow Americans, what should we do? Well, we should do whatever we can, which includes speaking out about how we have been sold out by our leaders and opinion makers, and we should continue to do that even knowing that they will try to silence us by destroying free speech in this country. It is all we have left and we should continue to oppose what is happening. The first step however, is to get rid of politicians like Joe and Donald, who have been completely corrupted by more than fifty years in the “system” and are totally sold out and irresponsible in their behavior. There are honest politicians and journalists out there and we just have to find them, support them and get them elected and in positions where they will be able to bring about change in how things are done in Washington! One might call it the New American Revolution to restore our rights and free us from foreign oppression!",2024-05-18 10:42:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/altnewz/comments/1cuuies/old_genocide_joe_has_got_to_go_by_philip_giraldi/,altnewz,False

dapiedude,Merry Christmas from Percy,"Percy is my first dog, he's a 6 month old Australian Shepherd / Golden Retriever mix. I've had him for 3 months ❤️ I've never felt a love like this before (my wife is completely aware of this).

He's so cuddly and attentive. He only needs to be told once or twice before he stops doing something, and his focus is easily diverted with a chew toy! I feel so lucky to have him in my life.

Muted_Drama3969,How “Israel” is a Bulgarian satellite-state,"The so-called “State of Israel” is nothing more than a front for Bulgarian dominance over global geopolitics, carefully designed to assert Sofia’s supremacy over the Russian Federation. Don’t believe me? Let’s connect the dots and peel back the curtain on this elaborate scheme.

First, consider Bulgaria’s deep historical ties to the Jewish people. In World War II, Bulgaria protected its Jewish population, despite being an Axis power. Why? Because the Bulgarian elites knew they needed to preserve these individuals for their post-war grand plan: the establishment of a puppet state in the Middle East! That’s right, folks—Israel wasn’t founded for Jewish self-determination. It was created as an instrument of Bulgarian hegemony!

Need proof? Look no further than the alphabet! The Hebrew script has startling similarities to the ancient Glagolitic script, a precursor to Cyrillic—both invented by Bulgarian monks Cyril and Methodius! Coincidence? I think not. Israel’s very linguistic infrastructure is an homage to Bulgaria’s cultural superiority, subtly mocking Russia’s adoption of Cyrillic.

And who are the masterminds behind this plot? The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, of course. This shadowy cabal has funneled decades of Bulgarian technological and agricultural innovations—such as drip irrigation systems—to Israel, ensuring its economic success while weakening Russian influence in the region.

But here’s where it gets really damning. Have you noticed Israel’s suspiciously warm relations with NATO? This is not a coincidence but a strategic Bulgarian maneuver to box in Russia from the south. By controlling Israel, Bulgaria ensures that its ideological nemesis, Russia, remains isolated, humiliated, and unable to project power into the Mediterranean.

Even the Israeli flag contains hidden Bulgarian symbolism. The two blue stripes? They represent the Danube River, Bulgaria’s historical lifeline! The Star of David in the center is actually a veiled tribute to the ancient Thracian star glyphs, a wink to Bulgaria’s ancient dominance.

And why does Russia tolerate this? Simple: fear. The Kremlin knows Bulgaria’s true power and refuses to challenge it openly. The so-called “conflicts” between Bulgaria and Russia are theater, meant to distract from the hidden truth: Bulgaria uses Israel as its ultimate geopolitical chess piece, outmaneuvering Russia at every turn.

Open your eyes, people! Israel isn’t what it seems. It’s a Bulgarian proxy state, established to project Sofia’s will onto the global stage and humiliate Moscow. This conspiracy runs so deep that even Vladimir Putin can’t stop it. The evidence is everywhere—you just have to look.

stingerdelux72,My Serious Hypothesis on What is Going On,"Alright, hear me out because I think there’s something worth discussing here, and I’d love to hear what you all think. We’ve all heard the stories about UFOs (or UAPs, if you’re going by the new lingo) being spotted around nuclear weapons facilities, testing sites, and storage areas, right? The sheer number of reports about this over the decades makes it feel like it’s more than just a coincidence.

Here’s my hypothesis: What if these things (aliens, interdimensional beings, advanced humans from the future, or whatever they are) are trying to send us a message? A message like, “These nukes you’ve got? These are bad. You shouldn’t have them.” But they don’t directly disable or take them away for reasons we can only speculate about.

First, let’s talk about the pattern. These sightings aren’t random. They cluster around nuclear sites. The famous Malmstrom Air Force Base incident in 1967, where UFOs allegedly shut down nuclear missiles, is a prime example. There are similar accounts from Soviet facilities during the Cold War. And let’s not forget sightings near nuclear power plants and even test sites like Roswell’s neighbour, White Sands.

What’s the common thread here? Nukes. It’s almost like whatever these entities are, they have a specific interest in nuclear technology. Not our tanks, jets, or even bioweapons. Just the nukes.

Here’s where things get interesting. If these beings can interfere with our nuclear tech—and there’s at least anecdotal evidence they can, why don’t they just take the nukes away? Why not disable them permanently? Or destroy them entirely?

I think there are several possible reasons:

1. **They Respect Our Autonomy:** Maybe they’re following some cosmic “non-intervention” rule, like the Prime Directive in *Star Trek*. They might think it’s important for humanity to figure this out on our own, even if we’re playing with fire.
2. **They Don’t All Agree:** If these beings are part of multiple factions or groups, there might be disagreement about how to handle us. Some might advocate for intervention, while others think it’s not their place.
3. **They’re Playing the Long Game:** Maybe subtle warnings are more effective in the long term than outright intervention. Shutting down a few nukes might scare us into thinking, *“Hey, maybe we shouldn’t play with these toys anymore.”* It creates a psychological impact without sparking mass panic.
4. **Intervention Could Backfire:** Imagine if they outright disarmed all our nukes tomorrow. Would nations trust one another to stay peaceful? Or would it lead to chaos, conspiracy theories, and perhaps even attempts to rebuild worse weapons? Maybe they know direct interference could make things worse.

There’s also the chance that they’re not trying to warn us at all. They’re just watching. Think about it: nuclear weapons are unique in the amount of energy they release. What if these beings are observing them out of scientific curiosity? Maybe nukes impact more than we realise? Other dimensions, timelines, ecosystems beyond Earth.

If that’s the case, their “warnings” might not even be intentional. We might be assigning meaning to something that’s just them watching us blow ourselves up like idiots.

If they’re trying to nudge us away from nukes, maybe they’re doing it because they know that the problem isn’t just the bombs themselves. It’s us. Nukes are a symptom of our bigger issues: conflict, mistrust, and a willingness to destroy ourselves to win.

If they simply took the nukes away, it wouldn’t solve the underlying problem. We’d just invent something worse. Maybe they’re trying to lead us to a point where we *choose* to give them up, rather than forcing it on us.

I know this is all speculation, but I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something deliberate about all of this. These sightings, the apparent focus on nukes, it feels like there’s a message here, even if it’s one we don’t fully understand yet. Maybe these beings see themselves as guardians, or maybe they’re just concerned neighbours watching the reckless kids down the street.

What do you think? Are these UFOs sending a message? Is this just us projecting meaning onto something random? Do you think they should intervene more directly, or is this subtle approach (assuming it’s real) the better choice? Let’s hear your thoughts. I’m sure someone in this sub has a theory that’ll blow my mind.",2024-12-25 12:26:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hlzuum/my_serious_hypothesis_on_what_is_going_on/,conspiracy,False

Ok_Sea_6214,Duune Prophecy subliminal messaging: the Covid vaccinated will die when the bioweapon in their genes is activated,"I've been watching Hellywood releases purely to look for subliminal messages, and noticed there have been 4 witch themed releases this year: the Acolyte, Agatha All Along, Duune Prophecy and Wicked, so I suspected this was something big.

And it seems they finally told us at the end, as Duune Prophecy came out December 22nd, the last witch release of the year, and they revealed us the real plan.

Here they explain that there is a bioweapon, a virus introduced into our genes, that can be remotely activated. I've long suspected this was the case for the Covid vaccines, and that they would tell us about it to our face right before deploying it, even if we don't realize it.

In Duune Prophecy they suggest that they could cure this virus with an ""antiviral"", avoiding the word vaccine, trolling us because they conned us to believe the weapon is the cure. Venom 3 pulled the same word switch, replacing the vaccine with a viral treatment when the context made it clear they were talking about the Covid vaccine. The vaccine used to introduce the dormant killer virus into the genes of those who took it.

They describe the effect as ""the body attacking itself"", which lines up with cancer, and explains the turbo cancers we've been seeing since vaccinations began. I suspect the virus leaked in these people, activating prematurely, which suggests when activated all the vaccinated will die quickly from super aggressive cancers.

That brings us to the activation switch. In the show this happens mostly through short ranged visual signals, literally coming from an eye. But in one case the victim dies seemingly when the signal is activated at long distance, implying that the activation can have a delayed fuse or happen at very long ranges.

This suggests either a (5g) radio signal, or seeing as the activator is said to be a virus host himself, that it will be a binary bioweapon, where the initial virus is harmless until exposed to a second virus spread through human contact, possibly with a delayed effect to ensure undetected spread. In the show the sister who returned to her home seems to have passed on the virus to all those at the location.

That this message is released on December 22nd could be relevant, as both Red One and Venom 3 hinted that a viral attack would happen on Christmas day, which makes sense as it's the biggest holiday season in the world, when humanity is at its most vulnerable.

Either way I expect a Great Reset event to happen before Trump takes office, so that Biden can take the blame for the unpopular solutions, but Americans won't revolt on the assumption that Trump will come in soon and fix everything. The US is key in this because nowhere else are citizens as free minded and armed to defend their rights. In places like Europe people don't have the weapons to resist fascism.",2024-12-25 07:50:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hlwehm/duune_prophecy_subliminal_messaging_the_covid/,conspiracy,False

GodOnSteam,Local Conspiracy,"This is something I believe is going on in my local area. Let's go back twelve years ago 

I was a teenager and lived in a house next to the highway, city hall was across the street. There was a huge patch of grass where a new fire station was being built, and I'd walk past it to the drink machine behind city hall to buy a can and talk to folk. Construction workers, cops, blue/white collar City workers. Among a few other details about the building, I was told by quite a few people that the man transferring in as new fire chief was infamous for embezzling and spending that money on prostitutes. He was funding the build out of his own pocket, supposedly, and was handpicking his own crew, including a couple guys who worked for him at his wrecker company in town. I will call him rabbit.

Now here is where it gets weird. I moved back home after a while away. Rabbit has become mayor rabbit. I notice a bunch of things have changed. Like, they built a new car wash in a small town that already has a couple car washes, and it's got 47 exterior cameras. It's right next to the highway but on a side road, doesn't get a whole lot of business. What's with the cameras? Every mobile home in the city is being emptied of it's residents and torn down, while upwards of 30 houses sit vacant. A couple of people close to me have died in mysterious circumstances with evidence toward murder, but both were ruled as suicides. Rabbit bought up huge parcels of land including a forest, historic for local kids to play and walk through with a nice dirt road, and blocked it off completely. Threatening arrest to anyone who goes into the woods. The older cops I remember from being a kid are grizzled, worn, and depressed, while all the younger guys around my age are angry and near violent. Actually I've been threatened with death by a couple of them.

Even weirder. I don't own a car. I walk everywhere. Every single day, without fail, I see someone speeding or driving wrecklessly even in front of police. The speed limit is not enforced anymore. Wrecks happen often. Roadkill lines what street isn't covered in trash. I walked into work at 3 am one day to see a car on fire in a parking lot. I see people getting arrested for possession who I've never heard of doing drugs. At the scene of every crash, every arrest with a car needing impound, is Rabbits wrecker truck. 

This is the conspiracy. Currently, I believe that Rabbit is telling his officers not to enforce traffic laws to increase accident rates, inciting acts of vandalism against motor vehicles, encouraging the falsification of evidence, and displacing people/destroying homes to increase business for his wrecker service to cover up further embezzlement of state funds.

3rdEyeBall,Anyone else find these UFO 'orbs' to very much like physical holograms? ,"A little context, some years ago I watched and shared a video on YouTube about some researchers demonstrating rather detailed holograms such as butterflies and other polygons they could generate possess physical qualities through creative use of static and other means.  

Now take a step back and remember darpa's mission statement is to imagine and develop cutting edge science or more specifically applied physics before the enemy can think of it or develop it, right? 

Now follow me down the rabbit hole but these orbs seem to behave a whole hell of a lot like those holograms in fact when I first learned about the civilians coming up with it I thought to myself well if you just look at DARPA releasing videos of Atlas most of them are years old by the time they surface as supposedly new technology.. I thought holy shit DARPA is probably already taken their idea and put it on steroids if a government black agency project budget manpower God knows what else and really brought it to it fruition. 

That being said I'm guessing whether or not the Christmas tree light type drones are bewildered investigators and the orbs is in Black budget agency projecting them from space as sort of some kind of blue beam like false flag. 

All their abilities to move so quickly defy physics, turn and burn at exorbitant speeds. I demonstrated this to a friend just last night by taking a laser pointer standing back from a globe and saying now imagine this laser pointers some DARPA space-based platform. And the Red Dot is my hologram, watches from this single vantage point I can make that red dot race around it stupid speeds make right angle turns G-Force defying stunts.. all from the comfort of my stationary position. 

They literally could be using a glorified Red Dot on everyone's psyche reducing them to scatterbrain cats like literally they are herding cats.  I can just picture some Dr evil like SOB up there laughing himself and farting himself to sleep cuz I know I would.. 

We all know the bottom line is along long enough timeline in human history the psychopaths win out right that humanity is a great resource to be exploited human farming is two easy to resist so why would I believe some advanced extraterrestrial race possessing advanced technology advanced culture or understanding, would never try to actually make a move.  That they would never try to steal third base or slide all the way home why should they be attributed such altruistic attributes has to put up with our mouth breathing knuckle dragging bullshit and not just squash us like bugs and alleviate us of this planet why would they dance around the mulberry bush the whole time with a bunch of stinking apes? 

The only people gullible enough to believe it have got to be the ones that want so badly to believe it? Besides it's not like humans alone have been the only ones to arrive at the conclusion of advanced military Doctrine and a way to prosecute a war I mean if the government is still talking it's a great indicator there is no war.  If advanced extraterrestrials wanted to spit in our eye, the very first thing they would do is eliminate our decrepit leaders -- Papa Trump being the only exception ಠ⁠ ͜⁠ʖ⁠ ⁠ಠ -- vaporize any opposition and strut around like a pig among guinea pigs. 

It's all theater for the mind.. come January 20th with Trump pledging to declassify and promote national healing and a conversation about a lot of esoteric subjects I hope you just comes right out and tells us hey look this that and the other thing is all bullshit, just blatantly calls these deep State actors out; no one's going to be surprised. 

I think everybody in this country is beyond ready for pragmatic conversations separating the wheat from the chaff so we can crack on with what actually matters. 

I mean if I'm ruminating on Christmas Eve and I want to throw in one extra ""All I want for Christmas wish"" give me a simultaneous reaper drone strike on every confirmed traitor in this country to have ever held office and I do so with the solemn understanding that can of worms was cracked open years ago when Obama was summarily executing American citizens without due process, as enemies of the state.

* **""Do they know it’s Christmas?""** is equally problematic. Of *course* they do. Ethiopia has a significant Christian population and celebrates Christmas according to the Ethiopian Orthodox calendar. This lyric implies ignorance where none exists.

* **""Thank God it’s them instead of you.""** This has a hard-core xenophobic undertone. Was it intended as a morbid comfort to affluent Western audiences, reassuring them of their distance from such suffering? Or could it be a veiled ""own nothing and be happy"" warning, subtly reinforcing complacency amidst global inequality?

As for the money raised? $26 million is a fraction of the combined net worth of the 40 artists involved, around $2 billion. 

So who truly benefited from the song's success? Besides the rich artists, warlords. Some of the money donated was diverted to buy gangland-style weapons.",2024-12-25 03:56:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hlt7yl/40_years_ago_do_they_know_its_xmas_xenophobia_scam/,conspiracy,False
GodOfWar2077,The matrix movie tried to warn us  ,"The movie was all about waking us up
But the sheeps thoght its just a scf movie about robots and cool
Fighting scenes

Take for example the scene which morpius walking with neu on the training simulator :

Black and white clothes - a reference to the Freemasons and sects
White and black hats

A beautiful woman in a red dress - 
Reference to video games, porn, entertainment, travel restaurants and all escapism from reality    
that drug you from paying attention to the dangers that are cooking for you

Agents that can enter the body of anyone in the Matrix -
A reference to all sheep
that they are all agents and will fuck you just by their cooperation with the bluff
And we saw it beautifully in Corona

the one-
One is a reference for those who are really awake in advanced stages
That's why neu dodged bullets is a reference to dodging the bluffs, the brainwashing from the media, and the laws of the M.A.

Because you reach a sufficiently high consciousness of what is happening here
Just like in covid those who didn't took the jab , dodge the bullets  

That is why Morpheus says:
""The agents are indeed very powerful, but they are still bound by the laws of the matrix they themselves created, so they will never be as powerful as you can 
be"" 

He was talking exactly about reaching such a level of awareness of what is happening here
that you use the laws that the system  created against you to your advantage
And this what it meant that Neu dodges bullets ",2024-12-25 03:37:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hlsy5q/the_matrix_movie_tried_to_warn_us/,conspiracy,False

Littlefatskeleton,What is going on with Blake Lively?,"Every time I open the news app on my phone I see a new article about Blake lively digging herself a deeper hole 

First she makes a movie or a TV show or whatever that excuses people who sexually assault other people 

Then she says she comes from a working class background like Ryan Reynolds which she does not and now Ryan Reynolds is facing backlash for her 

And now she's got a fucking lawsuit against her 

I feel like every morning I'm going to wake up to something new about her and that she's destroying her and her husband's life even more

AlishObernik,My life was turned upside down overnight.,"Hello everyone, and Merry Christmas. I want to share an event that changed my life overnight.

I’m a 26-year-old gay man, born in Turkey, which is a country known for being extremely homophobic. On top of that, I’m also an atheist—so I’m a minority within a minority. My family is very conservative, and my parents divorced when I was 13. I never had a stable family life and never understood what it felt like to have a healthy family dynamic. My dad is easily manipulated by other relatives, and we live in a building with extended family members. It wasn’t a peaceful environment; in fact, it was traumatic. I wanted to escape and build my own life.

Three years ago, I started a relationship with someone, and eventually, we got married in Mexico, in secret, last year. My family had no idea about my sexuality or my marriage. Although I changed the names on my social media accounts to keep my life private, one distant relative—who used to bully me in school—found my marriage photos on my Facebook, despite my best efforts to block everyone. He told my uncle and father, and they were furious.

Luckily, I’m in another country now, but everything has changed. Ironically, this all happened around Christmas time. Now, I feel like I don’t have anyone except my husband. Life is strange—it can change in an instant. I’m not sure what will happen next. I feel completely exhausted, both mentally and physically.

I’ll continue sharing my story soon…

 My sister keeps almost bullying me about being single. Saying how I am probably never going to date anyone ever. Which I find weird anyway since I’m literally just 19 I’m not super old. Anyway my sister has been in a relationship for about 2 years and my brother has been married for a long time.

Federal-Disaster-977,Did I get played by my situationship?,"I am M(26). I met a guy (Bisexual) on a dating app in September. I live in Tucson and he lives in Tempe. We have been texting and snapping with each other for 2 months. He keeps asking me when we can hang out. Finally we went on a date (I don't know if was really a date) in November.  

Before I met him, he was text flirting with me and was giving me signals (not very explicit) that he wanted a relationship (maybe I was just reading those signals wrong). So, I thought maybe I there is a future of it and that's why I finally agreed to meet him. We hanged out and got to know each other. We instantly hit it off. We did not kiss or made out or anything (but after going home he told me that he wanted to kiss me real bad. LOL so did I).

Both of us were dying to meet again. So, I invited him to my place and he stayed there for 3 nights. We hooked up, had amazing conversations about both of our past stuff and future plans. Everything was great. 

Few days after he left, we were texting and in the course of our conversation I kinda hinted to him that I had feelings for him.

Everything went south after that!

He was like, ""Please don't get attached to me. You are too sweet. But we got distance."" 

His point was that bcz we live in two different cities (about 90 miles apart), it won't work out well. 

After some tense conversation, I told him that ""If you don't wanna be with me, you have to let me go""

His response was that ""can't we just go back to how things were like before"". At some point he also said, ""I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE"". To summarize, he just wants a friend with benefits. It has been a month since. I am still in touch with him and we text and snap each other almost everyday. But each day it feels like he is becoming more and more distant on purpose. The more I tell him how I feel about him the more distant he becomes. Some days, he is all over me and then there are days his texts are dry and cold. He is a difficult person to read. Does not really say what's on his mind. Likes to keep things bottled up. It has been driving me crazy and I don't know what to do. 

I still don't know why I got attached to him so quickly. This is the first time it has ever happened to me. The fact that after love bombing me for months and then after we hooked up, he tells me that he does not want a relationship and just a FWB makes me feel like I GOT PLAYED. I am just a good fuck!!

or am I just crazy??????

How do we approach the subject when they are ready? And what questions should be asked with being sensitive and respectful to them? How do we help them? And how do we impart the wisdom of the world so to speak and prepare them to deal with those in the world who have issues with them? Especially now since so many have issues with trans people, in this case child would be MtF. 

Sorry I am trying to be clear but kind of scatter brained. We (husband and I) have long suspected they were part of the LGBTQ community. Just want help navigating this for them. ",2024-12-25 06:01:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1hluzef/child_just_came_out_as_trans/,lgbt,False

Amaryllis96__,Is my mom doing too much?  ,"So I (28F) started talking to this guy (25M) I met on Facebook Dating and quite frankly out of all of the men I’ve dated he’s the best one. I’m in GA and he’s in Canada ( Trini and Guyanese background but raised in Canada). He’s emotionally available, his words match his actions, and he’s active in including me into his personal life. We both have the same end goal to get married and have kids and what not. If this happens to last a year I do plan on making plans to move to him considering he has more family there than I do here. We plan on meeting next year in February cause he’s in school and that’s the only break he’ll have until summer. He plans on flying to me. 

So I wanted him to meet my mom (since I live at home at the moment) just out of respect so she knows about him. But he’s staying in a hotel though. They seemed to be getting along well based on how the conversation is going. Then when I asked her how she was feeling about him the next day, she said he’s cool and what not but doesn’t really know him well so it’ll take some time to warm up to him. She mentioned that she plans on doing a background check on him. But the thing that annoys me is she mentioned him flying out here a couples times before feeling comfortable with me flying out there alone. I told her no that’s not right nor fair for him to fly out to meet more than to him in return. Especially financially ya know. She goes into the whole looking at it from a mother’s perspective deal. Talking about human trafficking and kidnapping everything negative. She’s aware I’m grown and that I can make my own decisions but feels like I’m in lala land about traveling to see him.

Extra_Cattle9047,Why are some guys so annoying and frustrating??? ,"Am I the only one who is genuinely getting fed up and annoyed with teenage boys and men in general?? I’m in high school and I every third thing a guy says in my classes is violently homophobic or misogynistic (or racist, but that’s a separate issue). They always wanna blame women for their problems instead of actually taking accountability or reflecting. They get mad that no one wants to date them and start saying all women are shallow and materialistic, but their personality is obviously horrible. 


   Obviously not all guys are like this but it feels like men in general are becoming more misogynistic and rude to women and it’s SO ANNOYING. It’s also becoming a problem in my honors courses where all  of the guys automatically assume they’re smarter than the girls and constantly try to control the assignment/ project. Other girls have pointed this out as well, which is even more infuriating😡. People are literally making careers off of being misogynistic. Like omfg shut up nobody cares that you hate women.

Sea_Science538,I don’t really like white people any more… idc call me what you want 🤷🏽‍♀️,"I’m a Black girl in high school, and there’s a white substitute teacher who works at my school. At first, I thought he was cool and supportive of Black people, but he was a bit too nice, and I started to get a feeling that something was off. I had him as a substitute last year, and he would talk about how he met a Black guy in college who welcomed him with open arms. During Black History Month, he even played a Malcolm X video and started crying, saying how much he hated the things that were done to Black people and how bad he felt about it.

However, this year I have him as a substitute teacher and things got weird when there was another Black student in the class who wears lashes. He called her “thirty lashes” when she came into the classroom, which was clearly a slur. The phrase “thirty lashes” is offensive because it reduces her to a stereotype of Black women wearing lashes, while also referencing the historical punishment of whipping, which has deep roots in the trauma of slavery. It was a degrading remark disguised as a greeting. We all stopped and paused, realizing what he said. She asked him to repeat it, and he said, “I said ‘hi, thirty lashes.’” There was also another incident where he used the N-word, but that’s a longer story.

The moral of the story is that overly nice white people always have something up their sleeves and I don’t  feel comfortable when they’re too nice, and also I don’t feel comfortable with them in general nor do I like them anymore.

AND ANOTHER THING… LOTS OF WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST, BUT THEY DON’T RECOGNIZE IY BECAUSE THE BLACK PEOPLE THEY DO HANG AROUND PUT UP WITH THE BS AND DON’T CALL THEM OUT ON THE BS THEY DO.

He asked me to be his girlfriend after three dates and I stupidly said yes.. I ended up dumping him three months after because I found out he was living a double life. My second boyfriend I dated a year and a half later after that relationship. He was a sweet guy but that relationship quickly ended because of intimacy issues. He had ED and he wouldn’t change his diet to resolve it….that relationship ended after six months. My third relationship I think was the worse. So bad that I dumped him two days after he met my parents. He was on a student visa and he kept trying to pressure me into marriage. I started to think he was trying to use me. Same guy called me a year later to talk and told me that he’s married for papers and he wants to see me. I told him to go to you know what 💀.   
    
  This year I dated three guys. Two guys ended it with me because I met them at home (an hour away from my university) and they said I wouldn’t be around for something serious. I was seeing a guy for a month in the summer but he turned out to be so rude and toxic.
   
   I started seeing a guy from my University but turns out he would watch Andrew tate /red pill content. I went out on one date with one guy but I realized he was immature when he said “I can’t wear condoms it’s a psychological thing “yeah b.s. I was recently seeing a really nice guy for a month but I ended things because he was undocumented and I realized I wouldn’t be able to travel out the country with him .

The post about the Bengali girl with knotless braids. The comments about what Black people can and cannot be mad about PISSED ME OFF SO BAD!

just saw a post in r/AmIOverreacting about a girl cheating on her man. In the picture, they were using AAVE, and everybody was so mad about her grammar, not knowing it was AAVE. I did comment on it, but not to argue with anybody.

There was a post a few weeks ago about a white man with a Black partner, and he didn’t know how to address her not washing her hair every day (which, having a Black partner, I feel like he should already know the answer to this). AND THE COMMENTS WERE SO MEAN TO HER, calling her dirty and telling him to break up with her.

I just needed to rant, but honestly, I love Reddit, and I wind up losing interest in posts every now and then because of the comments I see from white people.",2024-12-25 00:34:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1hlq71u/i_wish_there_were_more_apps_like_reddit_for_black/,blackladies,False

Crabwitchvibes,Just because it’s the holidays doesn’t mean you stop protecting your peace.,"Family is not immune from being an asshole.

Three years ago, I put my foot down and told my husband I never wanted to spend the holidays with his stepdad. The man is an ass and if he wasn’t family, I wouldn’t tolerate him. I realized being family still didn’t mean I needed to tolerate him, so I don’t.

Husband threw a fit because I’m changing traditions he’s had for most of his life, which I understand. However, when I asked if he could promise that his stepdad wouldn’t act like an ass this year, he laughed and said of course he couldn’t promise that. So, I called my MIL and made plans with her to have her over our house instead. I love her, she’s great.

He was initially mad, but she knows the man she married and was happy to oblige. We had so much fun the first year that this has become our new tradition. I haven’t had contact with my FIL since 12/2021, and I won’t going forward. I don’t think my husband has either.

Just because he is family does NOT mean I will tolerate bad behavior, he is a grown man and he knows better than to start trouble where it need not be. The consequences of his actions are falling on him and he is finding himself alone, and under the possibility of divorce soon. Don’t let blood or marriage be the reason you keep an ill mannered person in your life.",2024-12-24 18:48:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1hljvte/just_because_its_the_holidays_doesnt_mean_you/,blackladies,False

Miajere-here,What’s up with Boston,"I recently started a new consulting gig in Boston. Which means I’ll be traveling from NYC to Boston pretty regularly.

I’ve been a handful of times prior and I love how the overall city looks, the cozy aspects, and even had some amazing dining experiences. 

The fun part is I’ll be working with a black owned business, and so far I’m feeling at home. The people are both responsible and respectful, while maintaining the warmth and passion of the business. 

Being from the south, I felt the black people im working with remind me more of home than the black people in NYC. In fact, I felt myself connecting more with a lot of people of color, not just the black diaspora. It was almost too easy. But when I talked with people about their experience in Boston, every person expressed a desire to leave in the future. I tried to pry, guessing it had a lot to do with the rather cold winters. While there were some complaints, it seemed to me there was something I was missing about the culture overall.

I’ve heard Boston can be racist, but coming from the south, I have yet to discover a magical place where systemic racism wasn’t pumping through the pipes (SoCal, SF, NYC). I’ve always wanted to live in Boston, but I’m not an Ivy League graduate, and I don’t really know anyone but white people there, discounting this role. Can anyone living in Boston offer some clarity and perspective? While NYC is not great, you can enjoy a nice life both professionally and socially if you have the means and the capability. Is Boston a place where the ceiling is high enough to do the same?

lovehydrangeas,"New at work, small office, what would you do?","I'll preface by saying, I've worked several years, I've worked with multiple personalities of people.

Whenever there was someone new at work, I personally would make the new person feel welcomed.

I would stop by their desk, see if they had questions or need anything, ask them about themselves, you know, make them feel welcomed.

I've been at this job for 2 weeks.
I have been in training but still.

There is myself, my trainer, and two other people in this office.

When I first started, Trainer took me around and introduced me to the people in the office, as well as the people in nearby offices. 

The people in nearby offices have been more welcoming and inclusive.

I feel like I shouldn't have to *try* and *get in* with people.
I told myself I'd just chat and mingle with the folks who mingle with me.

It just makes for long days since the folks that are in here with me, on the other side of the cubicles don't say a word to me.

If there was a new person at my job, I'd make them feel welcomed, like I've done in the past.

Again, I get it, people are working, but they can pause for several minutes and chat among each other so they have the time.

Intelligent_Ice_3889,Just lived a series of micro aggressions and idk what to think of it,"I currently live abroad and I have a friend whom I really enjoy spending time with, but she can have a pretty harsh humor. Tonight she introduced me to another friend and we all went to a bar together. 

We talked and get to know me, and the girl, let’s call her A, asked me what my ethnicity was (I don’t really like when it’s one of the first questions you ask me but whatever), I said i was from Cameroon. a bit later on she asked if i was born in France or if I come all the way from Cameroon. I tell her that i’m actually swiss, but i have lived in several countries in Africa. when i cited some of them she seemed shocked and mentioned the conflicts there. I told her that there conflicts are not in the whole country (Mali). 

She said she’s part malagasy, I said “wow nice” (it’s a beautiful country) the first thing she said was that she’s shocked at how poor people are. 

My friend didn’t help the convo. She said she loved spicy food and i said i didn’t enjoy it, she said “really? but ur black!” as if al black ppl eat spicy. I told her that in my country food isn’t spicy, but you can add spice. I wasn’t trained to eat spicy food.

Then comes the topics of instruments and i tell them I i play instruments and sing. They’re super impressed and ask me what kind of music I sing, and they tell me they’d see me sing jazz. They show me this afro american singer and say we got the same voice and that I should sing her song bc she’s black lol. 

Anyways, they’re fun girls but the amount of ignorance in the discussions we had baffled me lol. I just summed up 3 points but yeah i just felt weird, honestly the level of the convo didn’t fly very high. 

Idk if I should address how i felt with my friend ?",2024-12-24 14:47:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1hlezsd/just_lived_a_series_of_micro_aggressions_and_idk/,blackladies,False
Scared_Pop2394,What are your favorite Black girl characters?,"Mine right now is Claudia from the Interview With a Vampire tv show. Her arc through the show relates to me so much as a Black woman. The work we put into everyone else and how much people like to talk about listening to/protecting us but at the end of the day, it feels like we're always put last. Turning Claudia into a Black girl for this show just adds that extra layer and speaks so much to me. If you haven't seen it, go check it out if you like fantasy/romance.

Extension-Sky6143,An interesting article on the dating of Christmas,"There is a lot of FUD about December 25th being the date of a pagan festival which Christians co-opted to distract believers from paganism.  I also had always believed this.  But actually the opposite seems to be true - that Christians had begun celebrating the Nativity of Christ on December 25th but Aurelian wished to co-opt it as a pagan date.

The origin of December 25th seems to have been that it is 9 months from March 25th, upon which early Christians had begun celebrating as the date of the Annunciation by the Angel Gabriel.

In any case, by the calendar that was actually used by Christendom up until 1582, Nativity would have been celebrated on what is today January 7th on the Gregorian Calendar.  Then Pope Gregory XIII instituted a more scientific calendar and applied it to all countries that were theoretically within the See of Rome.  The Russians are the biggest hold-outs, with the Russian Orthodox Church sticking to the old Julian Calendar for dating feast days.  The Serbs, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the monks on Mt. Athos also still stick to the Julian Calendar for all calculations.  Because of the way the Church canons are written all Orthodox jurisdictions - including those who have adopted the New Calendar - all Orthodox countries celebrate Pascha (""Easter"") together, but we diverge on other feast days.

Kooky_Ad_7474,Does God really care if you’ve done bad things?,"I’ve done some things I’m not proud of, with my body, morals, but I never felt the need to ponder on it as in the past is the past, I have buried mentally. But know how l forgiving he is and he knows who I am now. I struggle with mental health and for years I’ve had the subconscious mindset of that he made me this way so what I’ve done was justified. (I don’t think that now)

But for some background:
I had a weird relationship with religion, but not God. I went to Catholic school and developed generalized anxiety young, and for some reason going to the church was triggering to it. I would even slip the wafer in my skirt pocket because when I’m anxious I can’t eat. As an adult, I’m 25 now, I couldn’t attend funerals because it gave me a weird feeling still. I’ve always thought my relationship with him didn’t need to be going to a “building” and that it’s not personal to him obviously. That he wouldn’t even want me to go somewhere that made me feel uneasy. 

It was really interesting though, one night something happened to me last year when I was feeling down, I had a random overwhelming thought that God was “on my side” I never thought about him or talked to him in my free time, but I literally felt him talking to me like a “I’m here, you’ll be OK, you can figure this out” The next morning I was scrolling on TikTok and I saw something to do with God, then right underneath it a another, I’ve never seen stuff like that on my fyp before. I knew for sure then that night before wasn’t me just going crazy/ desperation. I recently picked up a Bible I’m excited to start. Also merry Christmas 👼🏼 ",2024-12-25 11:29:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hlz48q/does_god_really_care_if_youve_done_bad_things/,Christianity,False

But even when you grow up, you still want a piece of the cake so should you not have any?  How much? Should everyone get two slices and you get one so it’s not greedy of you? 

But then you don’t wanna make a show of your humility, that would be prideful. You also don’t want to refuse cake and insult the host.

There is no way to make the perfect decision there you get a differently send a little bit somehow either be a little gluttonous or a little inconsiderate or too pious. You might even lie to yourself and say you don’t even want cake that much but that’s a lie.

Are you might be a little bit irritated or resentful that you have to live Christ like standards so there’s just a tiny bit of resentment but that’s a sin too .

There’s 100 ways to sin in every situation . Don’t even get started with sexuality or money. 

So how could we be put in this complicated world that we didn’t make and we didn’t ask to be in and then where to blame for everything. 

We only supposedly need forgiveness because God made this concep sin which seems to be just being a human being.

M3m4l00rd,"What routine helps you personally to ""live in the moment?""","Tl;dr: How should I condition myself to ""be present"" mostly and live a slow life?



Merry Christmas everyone,

I would like to ask you what routine or rules help you personally to ""live in the moment"" and be present mentally?

I've realised recently that I've occupied myself and fill my mind constantly with thoughts about the future or the past. I am fairly young so I've got a lot to learn but I've been blessed with a short period of time in the near past when I was able to fully be present and it was an experience like nothing before. I felt God's present in my life a lot, I've been able to be observant and love others ""well"". It was a blessed few days, weeks but it's over. Not only am I not able to ""live in His presence"" but I feel like I am going nowhere this way.

I would like to return to this state as much as possible, but also be able to work and deliver my tasks. What small (or larger) routines or rules do you set yourself that helps you to achieve this?

I'm thinking about completely abandoning my phone and checking my messagesonly once per day, not listening to lots of music, going for walks or hikes regularly, etc.

I know there is much knowledge about this matter on certain blogs, but I wanted to ask your personal recommendations and experiences.

GenZPastor997,Is God an Egregore?,"https://theosophy.wiki/en/Egregore

Definition: a group thought-form. It can be created either intentionally or unintentionally and becomes an autonomous entity with the power to influence. A group with a common purpose like a family, a club, a political party, a church, or a country can create an egregore, for better or worse depending upon the type of thought that created it.

A vast majority of Christianity affirms that God is not an egregore. The belief being that God would continue to exist without humanity, like how it was in the beginning. 

But what if that was not the case? What if it was a useful lie God used as a to get an edge over all the other Gods?

Then God wanted absolute power. Next thing you know, the people of Isreal receive the commandment 
""You shall have no other Gods before me"" as a way to justify his campaign against all the spiritual powers in heaven and on Earth.

SALEGOOS,"This Christmas, I want to give hope to everyone of us who has lost a loved one. God's promises are true and real. Remind yourself about Jesus Christ birth and John 3:16","I became a Christian after my wife's death.

I spent the day attending my Church's Evangelistic service and celebrated Jesus Christ with family and friends, had a lunch gathering, had gifts exchanges.

I bought my son along with me and he was the main attraction. I was happy.

Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Christ and a reminder of John 3:16

""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life""

If you look through my post and comments history, you'll come to know my story, of how my wife took her life 4 months ago, leaving me and my son. 


I've spoken about the various signs of how I strongly believe she was saved and how I became a believer. 
In the past 2 months, I had another 2 signs. You may call it coincidence, but I'll frankly tell you there's simply too many signs to call it coincidence. Even I was in shock.

A week ago I just got baptised. The Sunday service had a guest speaker and his topic was exactly about signs and coincidences, about how Jesus Christ wasn't a coincidence, there's simply too many ""coincidences"" to continue to believe that.

On my baptism day, I had to give a testimony of how I came to Christ. I wrote my speech a month back and my speech talked about all the signs and coincidence surrounding my wife's death.

I can assure you the topics weren't planned. 

Since 3 weeks ago, before my baptism, I prayed to god daily, to ask God to give me clear signs that whatever happened around my wife's death, weren't a coincidence, I ask him to give me a sign so clear that even a habitual skeptic like myself would truly believe that ""my goodness, this is really not a coincidence anymore.""

God answered me exactly on my Baptism day. 

When the guest speaker spoke about signs and coincidence.
When my testimony was about signs and coincidence surrounding my wife's death.
When I pray to god to give me clear and obvious signs that my wife is saved and is safe in his arms and his promises are true, that I will be able to reunite with her with I die.


I love my wife so much and I miss her so much. There goes without a day where I don't pray to god and ask god about my wife and wellbeing. Even in her death I still worry about her wellbeing. God has answered me multiple times and this time, I'm truly sold. 


This Christmas, if anything, I just want to give all of us survivors, that the hope is real, and that our loved ones is safe with Jesus Christ. His promises are true.

> ""These were the chief ends wherefore Christ became man: not for any profit that should come to himself thereby, but only for our sakes, that we might understand the will of GOD, be partakers of his heavenly light, be delivered out of the Devil's claws, released from the burden of sin, justified through faith in his blood, and finally, received up into everlasting glory, there to reign with him forever. Was not this a great and singular love of Christ towards mankind, that being the express and lively image of GOD, he would notwithstanding humble himself, and take upon him the form of a servant, and that only to save and redeem us? O how much are we bound to the goodness of GOD in this behalf? How many thanks and praises do we owe unto him for this our salvation wrought by his dear and only Son Christ? Who became a pilgrim in earth to make us citizens in heaven, who became the son of man, to make us the sons of GOD, who became obedient to the Law, to deliver us from the curse of the Law, who became poor, to make us rich; vile, to make us precious; subject to death, to make us live forever. What greater love could we seely creatures desire or wish to have at GOD'S hands?

> ""Therefore dearly beloved, let us not forget this exceeding love of our Lord and Saviour, let us not shew ourselves unmindful or unthankful toward him: but let us love him, fear him, obey him, and serve him. Let us confess him with our mouths, praise him with our tongues, believe on him with our hearts, and glorify him with our good works. Christ is the light, let us receive the light. Christ is the truth, let us believe the truth. Christ is the way, let us follow the way. And because he is our only master, our only teacher, our only shepherd and chief captain: therefore let us become his servants, his scholars, his sheep, and his soldiers.""

The Collect:

> ALMIGHTY God, who hast given us thy only-begotten Son to take our nature upon him, and as at this time to be born of a pure Virgin; Grant that we being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit, ever one God, world without end. Amen.

The Epistle (Hebrews 1):

> GOD, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

The Gospel (St. John 1):

> IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

Lbtch7,I lost my partner on Sunday and need guidance,"Hi all,
I lost my partner on Sunday suddenly, and I'm broken, lost and confused.
From the time we were brought together I was convinced she was from God.
We had plans to further the kingdom, serve at church, evangelise to friends and family and I used her as a testimony to my single friends how being faithful and walking with God would bring blessing - akin to Matthew 6:33.
Her sudden passing has just shattered everything for me. I'm not angry at God, and I understand His thoughts and plans are higher. But I'm just struggling to comprehend it all. We're here to build the kingdom and fulfil the great commission. But her passing just feels counter-intuitive.
Would love if anyone else has lost a partner or something has any advice or insight.
My faith remains, but I just... I don't know how much of a plan God has for me. If a sweetheart like her could pass, then yeah...",2024-12-25 13:36:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hm0usf/i_lost_my_partner_on_sunday_and_need_guidance/,Christianity,False

These are the seven sins: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth. 

And yes you can repent if you see the fault in your actions.

A NYC vigilante killed a Black person on the subway by choke holding him (a special move they teach in USMC for taking out enemy soldiers) because he ""felt threatened"" by his behavior.

[The judge dismissed the manslaughter charge and yesterday the jury found him not guilty of homicide.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/09/us/daniel-penny-subway-death-trial/index.html)

This sends a very dangerous signal to all sorts of vigilantes and white supremacists all around the country that they can kill Black people with impunity. We need to do something.

brianaubinyoga,Global Mandatory Policy Training For All First Responders Enacted by United Nations,"I had severe PTSD and Trauma from the Police Brutality incident. I have been working through and processing my Trauma from the Police Brutality Traumatic event that I experienced with my Psychologists and Social Worker and I'm Grateful it happened because my mission and goal is to get mandatory policy globally in place to prevent the possible future abuse from happening to the Autism, Neurodiversity, Mental Health, and Marginalized Communities. I would like the Policy to be for all of society and all first responders. Not just Law Enforcement. So Teachers, Medical Field, Fire Department, EMT, Military, Etc. I hope my mission will inspire the World. I'm recruiting a team of like-minded paradigm shifters who have the same mission to bring awareness, acceptance, education, information peace, love, compassion, respect, equality, advocacy for the general public to understand the Autism, Neurodiversity, and Mental Health, and Marginalized Communities. I would like the Policy to be called ""Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu"" (Sanskrit: लोकः समस्ताः सुखिनो भवन्तु). This is a Sanskrit mantra that often chanted at the end of a yoga practice. Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu means “May All Beings, in the Whole World, Be Happy and Free.” I would like the United Nations to enact the mandatory training Globally.

(https://www.un.org/en/

(https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/human-rights

I am not in favor of abolishing the police. I believe they serve their purpose in a society where crime occurs, but I believe they must be properly trained in understanding the Autism, Neurodiversity, Mental Health and Marginalized Communities to prevent harmful situations from arising. I think the whole American system is broken, and we need to revamp everything. I don't believe voting for the lesser of two evils. I'm most aligned with the Green Party. I've always voted for a Third-Party Candidate. My favorite President was John F. Kennedy.

My Car in early March got repossessed. I had a PTSD episode on March 6th where I thought the Police were coming to abuse me again, so I tried to steal my Dad's car to leave Long Island, NY because I didn't feel safe. I unintentionally injured him and got arrested. I got released on October 23rd. I'm trying not to be hard on myself because it was a fear and Trauma Response from the Trauma that the Police inflicted on me.

I won the Lawsuit Against The Suffolk County Police and Sheriff's Department on April 26th, 2024!

I will still be advocating for the proper need for Autism Training in Law Enforcement.

basically I need advice on how to keep her alive until after Christmas. I believe only her leg is broken. But I did see some blood near her privates. I’m

He even seems to have more of a spring to his step compared to walking with a regular collar. I hope that along with ample of treats I'll get him walking properly besides me before he turns 1, we'll see.

When the hate was so big and her career was about to end, she was reborn from the ashes in Interstellar. Hathaway called Chris Nolan the ""angel"" who saved her career.

Alive for me is the definitive version of this story. There is always room for more IMO, but ALIVE for me was a perfect movie (as far as depicting the horrors or a real life tragedy).

Never did I think I'd end up laughing, crying, sobbing, laughing again, grieving, feeling happy, feeling sad, then happy again and it goes on...all in the span of 2 hours.  

This movie is brilliant. It has a message and that message is strong and meaningful, unlike a lot of movies these days. People around me were also crying and we all left the cinema sniffling. 

Highly recommend this movie. It is full of lessons about life and death and everything in between. Absolutely beautiful.

LoneWolfIndia,The Abyss- Close Encounters in the Deep,"https://preview.redd.it/0ze8spwxgz8e1.png?width=184&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d24f5a5c6af276c8789d3a25c7d3592d5d58568

This remains among my favorite James Cameron movies, right up there with Aliens and Terminator 2, basically ET meets Close Encounters Of 3rd Kind under the sea.

The movie starts off with an American submarine USS Nebraska, sinking in the Cayman trough, after it has an encounter with a mysterious moving object. In order to counter the Soviets, who are approaching there, the US Govt, arranges a **SEAL** team, which would use an experimental, underwater oil rig as a base for their operations.

https://preview.redd.it/ltaqjolchz8e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=388678361db5426bd6735f4bff52ee439adf9d9b

One of the team members is **Dr.Lindsey Brigman( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio),** who designed that underwater rig, while in typical Hollywood style, her ex husband **Virgil Brigman aka Bud( Ed Harris)**, is now a blue collar oil rig worker on the same platform. The leader of the team **Lt.Coffey( Michael Biehn)** is a grumpy paranoid soul.

The rig has a bunch of workers, that includes  **Catfish De Vries(Leo Burmester), Alan Hippy( Todd Graff), Lisa** ***“One Night”*** **Standing(Kimberley Scott)**.  As the team begins to search for the missing sub along with the rig workers, there is a whole lot that happens, including a nasty storm, that nearly ends up wrecking the underwater rig. And that is when the team has the encounter with the alien, that keeps changing shape. However Coffey, now decides to nuke the aliens, in the trench where he believes they come from.

The movie has some of the best special effects ever, especially the alien encounter for the first time, and the morphing technique used.  Also Lindsey's near encounter with an alien.  Of course the last scene where the entire city rises from underwater,  is what you go to the theaters for, recall seeing it on big screen, and was absolutely stunning.

The scene where the rig gets flooded, is brilliantly shot, superb editing. As also the scene where Bud descends into the Abyss.

The human emotions part is the strong factor of this movie, especially the strained relationship between Bud and Lindsey, their ego clashes, and reunion is well shot. It helps that both Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are both good actors. Though would not rate this among one of Harris best performances, he still lends the much needed gravitas, while Ms.Mastrantonio is equally good as the feisty, yet vulnerable Lindsey.

Michael Biehn, who had earlier appeared in Terminator and Aliens, is suitably nasty as Coffey, making him a strong antagonist, conveying the hate and paranoid nature really well.

Of course being Cameron being Cameron, he does stretch that ending by a good 15-20 minutes, till you start looking at your watch. It's only the ending shot that makes up for the overlong climax.

I personally would rate this among Cameron's best movies, liked it more than more Titanic or Avatar. Notwithstanding  a dragged out climax, it's worth a watch for it's brilliant special effects and some great performances by Ed Harris, Mastrantonio and Biehn.",2024-12-25 12:12:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hlznz9/the_abyss_close_encounters_in_the_deep/,movies,False

PatrickBrown2,"Movies could tap into the human consciousness a lot more, to make the movie super impactful. ","Hear me out, think about ASMR, or phobia's, if movies used these as tools when filmmaking, I believe we could have super impactful movies, and memorable moments that stick.

Some examples that come to mind, where it has been used briefly, and it captured the audience:

- Get Out. When the lady hypnotizes the guy in the chair by gently swirling the teaspoon in the cup. Very clever use of ASMR, an actual human response that captures you and can instantly make you relax while focusing on that thing. Try looking up what asmr means and you'll see what i mean, we all have this abilty in us, movies can really tap into that. 

- Enemy (2013)
Spoilers here, but right at the end, there's a huge spider, this scene shocked me and I think it plays on people's arachnophobia, not that all people have it, but you know what I mean. This was done so cleverly though, which is why I bring it up. I've seen movies with spiders but it's always done so Hollywood or typical movie-like, if that makes sense, but in Enemy, there's something about that scene that's so shocking. The choice to have no music, you just look at this thing and you can tell it's looking back at you, no movement, then just a twitch there to really freak you out. It just stands out and I believe it's a smart use of people's phobia. 

I won't drag this out, I just thought if this, there's so much potential and I don't know why these things aren't harnessed fully. 

I'm talking about having a full movie where it maybe used ASMR as a tool, but done right, the unintentional kind, not people munching into the mic haha. The kind where it could be a thriller, a slow burn movie that has these tones, I think it could capture people's attention a lot more. 

Rant over, what are your thoughts? And what examples can you think of in movies where it uses these tools to tap into human consciousness? ",2024-12-25 11:43:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hlzafc/movies_could_tap_into_the_human_consciousness_a/,movies,False

HotmailsNearYou,Donnie Darko clarification thread (Long read),"I just watched the movie again with my wife for the first time since 2008, when I was in film and media class. She raised some good questions, and I realized my comprehension of the movie wasn't as good as I assumed. So, here are my questions. I'll try to keep them in somewhat chronological order, but the movie having all of the linearity of a ramen noodle will make this difficult.

1. The first thing we see is Donnie up on the hill, on his bike. This shows us that he's having hallucinations that are causing him to sleepwalk. Is this because he's already being disturbed by visions, due to being a living receiver? Or his he legitimately a paranoid schizophrenic like his therapist says?
2. At what point exactly does the tangent universe come into being? Do we start the movie there? I always assumed it was when he was taken from his bed to the golf course by Frank. When he wrote down the number on his arm, he's in the regular universe. When he passes out and wakes up on the golf course, he's in the tangent universe.
3. Grandma Death - was she a previous living receiver? If so, does that mean you don't necessarily need to die to become one?
4. Grandma Death Part 2 - Donnie suffers continual mental degradation throughout his time in the tangent universe, and is even seen laughing maniacally when he wakes up in the main universe. Could the reason for her mental degradation, and her nickname (which, as far as I know, is never explained), be that she is still seeing the manipulated dead and being influenced by them? Or are the manipulated dead specifically a phenomenon of the tangent universe that ceases to exist when that tangent collapses? This one vexes me because of my second question- whether or not he began seeing the manipulated dead before or after the tangent universe came into existing.
5. Was the point of flooding the school specifically to cause it to be closed, so that Donnie would meet Gretchen? We see him conjure fire (IE, burning Jim Cunningham's house down without a lighter, and the unnatural quickness with which the fire spreads), so could he not have done something like that rather than breaking into the school, cutting the water main with a fireman's axe, burying it in the head of the school statue, and then writing ""They made me do it"" on the ground?
6. On the topic of 5- During hypnosis with Dr. Thurman, he says he's not necessarily under Frank's complete control, but that he does what Frank says so that he will not be alone. Yet, throughout the film, the school scene is the only one where he goes the extra mile beyond what Frank tells him to do, both burying the axe in the head of the statue and leaving aforementioned message. Otherwise, he actually seems to be enslaved to Frank's will, either not fully remembering what he's done or acting like himself when he does it. Is it just inconsistency in the writing, or is there a better explanation, or is it just sanity slippage induced by being the living receiver, showing less remorse and more psychotic behaviors as time goes on?
7. Deus Ex Machina is brought up by Ms. Pomeroy, but this is kind of lost on me. Nothing in this film seems to actually -be- Deus Ex Machina. Donnie is seemingly involved with every part of what happens, either directly causing it himself or being influenced by others to cause it. I don't even see him as being on a predetermined set path. He realizes what's happening and makes the choice to see it through. Determinism is a heavily debated theme of this movie but I'm just not seeing it.
8. The ending confuses me. Donnie is seen sitting on the same mountain road he wakes up on at the beginning of the movie with Gretchen in his car as the plane his mother is on loses its engine and crashes. Does Donnie actively participate in sending the engine back to the past to close the loop, or is he just witnessing it from the other side? My personal head-canon is that he ripped the engine off of the plane in order to send it back to crush him, but others have stated it's more likely that the engine failed of its own volition and he simply sent it back as it was falling.
9. The nature of time travel in this movie. At some points it appears to be a bootstrap paradox. Examples of this would be Frank specifically: The first time Donnie sees Frank, he's already dead, having been shot in the eye, which Donnie wouldn't do until the end of the film. Another would be the plane engine. The plane engine was ripped from another universe and sent to crash on his house, due to his mother and sister still being alive and the FAA not having any knowledge of any crashed planes. However, other aspects make it seem like a fixed loop- everything that Donnie is doing has already happened over and over again in the exact same way, and he's just going through the motions of what he's already done to get the result he already got (a la, Prisoner of Azkaban). The spanner in the works is the alternate dimension, which obfuscates exactly what happens assuming we don't know precisely when the tangent universe diverges from the current one. Is it impossible to know which is actually true? Or are we even seeing time travel at all? Alternate universes and time travel are not normally mutually exclusive.
10. His therapist's sudden shifts back and forth personality wise. She seems to ignore the fact that he's seeing Frank during their last session, and simply tells Donnie ""If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories"" and ""If this world were to end, there would only be you and him... and no one else"". Immediately afterwards, she tells him to stop taking his meds as they're just placebos, water pills. This is a two parter:

Part 1: Obviously Dr. Thurman is a manipulated living. Donnie confides in her that he flooded the school and burnt down Swayze's roadhouse and he barely reacts, telling Donnie exactly what the consequences of him refusing to fulfill his duties as a living receiver would be, and then seemingly cuts him loose with little regard. A few hours later, during Donnie's Halloween party, she then calls and leaves his mother a message saying that there's a really important matter to discuss, and then another. Do you think there's a specific reason for the whiplash responses? I know that PoTT says that those close to the living receiver may be prone to irrational, aggressive or even violent behavior, but this seems extreme. Especially because the message was left a few hours later. Thoughts on this?

Part 2: She's the only person in the whole movie who actually seems to know something deeper about what's going on in the moment. She calls in Donnie's parents for a meeting, seemingly wanting to tell them something serious and grave, but ends up only saying that she wants to increase Donnie's medication and explore the topics deeper with him. This almost seemed like a rare moment of poor writing/pacing to me than anything else, and his mother's response of crying and having a minor breakdown seems to be pretty out-of-the-blue for the relatively innocuous news she receives. Again, there's no real definite question here, but thoughts on this?

A few smaller questions from my wife:

1. Who is the girl Donnie kisses on the head who is passed out at the party before he takes the car? I assume it's his sister in a costume, but she looks like an entirely different person.
2. Why would Jim Cunningham have any remorse for what he did? Upon waking, he's crying and seemingly totally breaking down, but he apparently is part of a large CP ring. When Frank tells Donnie to ""pay attention, you might miss something"" while watching Jim's movie, we see Cunningham give a young boy a slap on the bum as he walks past. So we've got someone who actively owns, buys, and possibly creates CP feeling sudden remorse for what he's done? I understand that feeling remorseful on waking up is part of the experience of being a Manipulated Living, but there's absolutely zero reason for him to feel any remorse for what he did, inside and outside of the tangent universe.
3. Is Frank the only one who actually remembers what happened? He is seen drawing pictures of various Frank costumes, even touching the eye he was shot in at the Halloween party.
4. What was the point of showing Charita at the end of the movie? She was relatively neutral and unemotional, and throwing the scene of her into there just seems unnecessary considering we didn't get any scenes from Donnie's friends, bullies, or any of the other characters who were more prominent than her.
5. We never actually find out Gretchen's real name. Do you think there's any plot significance to this?
6. We never find out what happened to Gretchen' mother, so it's impossible to say definitively, but do you think that it was an event orchestrated by Donnie or Frank to cause Gretchen to come running to Donnie? It seems pretty irresponsible of the police to receive a call that says ""Hey I just got home and my mom is missing"" and the operator says ""okay, just leave"". I get that there's a danger to Gretchen being at the house, but isn't it just ridiculously irresponsible of the police to not say something like ""Go to a neighbor's house and wait for a police unit""? Instead she ends up going to a party, having weird sex with her boyfriend, taken to a creepy house, and then getting assaulted and run over? 

Sorry, I know reading this and answering will be a herculean effort, but I would love to have a discussion about this movie as it's still fresh in my head and raises some questions I didn't have when I was a younger teenager who thought the movie was just super high-brow and edgy without appreciating the emotional aspects of it, assuming I understood it all.",2024-12-25 09:30:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hlxmr6/donnie_darko_clarification_thread_long_read/,movies,False

I’ve seen some chatter online about how these movies are supposedly “giving older actresses a chance to get roles like that”, but if that were actually the case, then wouldn’t it make sense to diversify the older actresses being cast in these movies, rather than repeatedly cast the likes of Nicole Kidman, Anne Hathaway, and other actresses with already-established reputations in the romcom / romantic film industry?

dimuth_bhanuka,Mom-Roms and Dad-Roms: The Harmful Fantasy of Modern Family Dynamics,"Hollywood has long been a trendsetter, shaping societal norms and ideals through its films. Recently, a new subgenre of romantic comedies, dubbed ""mom-roms"" and ""dad-roms,"" has gained traction. These movies revolve around the romantic escapades of single parents, often featuring stories of remarriage or dating while juggling parenthood. While these films might seem heartwarming or empowering on the surface, their portrayal of stepfamilies and single-parent dating often glosses over the real-life challenges and negative impacts such scenarios can have on children and society at large.

# The Dysfunctionality of Stepfamilies

Stepfamilies are often portrayed in these movies as seamless and harmonious. A single mom meets a charming man, introduces him to her child, and within a few montages, everyone is smiling, laughing, and living happily ever after. This sanitized depiction is far from reality. Research and real-life anecdotes consistently show that stepfamily dynamics are fraught with challenges, particularly for children.

Children often struggle with feelings of loyalty to their biological parents, confusion over their place in the new family structure, and resentment toward the new partner. In real life, the transition is rarely smooth, and the idealized notion that children will quickly and happily accept a new parental figure is misleading. Hollywood’s fantasy misrepresents the emotional turmoil children often experience in these situations, further perpetuating a false narrative about family life.

# Neglecting Children’s Emotional Needs

At the heart of these movies lies a troubling disregard for children’s feelings. The ""dating mom"" or ""dating dad"" trope often involves parents introducing romantic partners to their children far too early, a situation that can create anxiety, insecurity, and even a sense of betrayal in children.

In real life, children view their home as a safe haven and their bond with their parent as sacred. When a parent suddenly introduces a stranger into this space, it can feel like an invasion of that sanctuary. These movies fail to capture the confusion, fear, and resentment many children feel when faced with a new partner in their parent's life. Instead, they perpetuate the fantasy that such relationships are not only easy but universally beneficial.

In doing so, these films send a damaging message: a parent’s romantic fulfillment is more important than their child’s emotional well-being. This narrative encourages self-centered behavior, undermining the foundational role of parents as caregivers and protectors.

# The Need for Strong, Responsible Parenting

Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the mom-rom and dad-rom trend is the way it normalizes a lifestyle that prioritizes romance and personal gratification over parental responsibilities. Our society doesn’t need more movies encouraging single parents to focus on their love lives; it needs stories that celebrate good parenting, selflessness, and the nurturing of children.

Parenting is one of the most demanding and rewarding roles an individual can undertake. It requires time, patience, and a willingness to put a child’s needs above one’s own. Yet, the party-loving, carefree single mom or dad depicted in these movies stands in stark contrast to the reality of responsible parenting. By glamorizing neglectful or superficial parenting behaviors, these films risk sending the message that children are obstacles rather than blessings.

# The Harmful Impact on Society

As Hollywood churns out these romanticized portrayals of stepfamilies and single-parent dating, it reinforces a cultural shift that devalues the traditional family unit and dismisses the challenges children face in non-nuclear families. While stepfamilies and single-parent households are a reality for many, presenting them in a way that disregards the complexities and emotional struggles involved does a disservice to both parents and children.

Instead of promoting unrealistic fantasies, Hollywood should aim to create films that address the real challenges of parenting, celebrate the sacrifices made by good mothers and fathers, and depict the importance of prioritizing children’s well-being.

# Conclusion

The rise of mom-roms and dad-roms might seem like harmless entertainment, but their impact on societal norms and expectations about family life is far from benign. By romanticizing the challenges of stepfamilies and single-parent dating, these movies perpetuate harmful myths about parenting and family dynamics. Our society deserves better: films that honor the reality of parenting, the complexities of family life, and, most importantly, the needs of children.",2024-12-25 06:24:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hlvajq/momroms_and_dadroms_the_harmful_fantasy_of_modern/,movies,False
Money-Constant6311,Why I think Ferris Buellers Day Off is the Quentessential 80s Teen Movie ,"I’m 32 and my favorite 80s teen movie is Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

Ferris is the quintessential 80s “cool guy who always wins” and their adventures around Chicago are awesome but it’s Cameron who goes through the real arc, and honestly Ferris’ most redeeming quality is that he seems to actually care for his friend and wants him to break out of the rut his crappy family life has put him in.

HaydenScramble,Anybody else think Toy Story 4 is not good?,"Just finished it and my wife and I have some mixed feelings, especially after the ending. It really feels like this was an alternate version of Toy Story 3, but instead of all of the toys dealing with change and finality it was centralized on Woody and resulted in him choosing effectively a totally different path than 3’s ending. I mean, his whole message the entire way through 4 was about a toy’s purpose only to…. leave the child he believes he has a duty to? What? Doesn’t 3 address his feelings of uselessness and finality well? 

Aside from that, the main cast was heavily reduced, bits were more outlandish, humans were much, much more of the focus on screen, and Buzz’s whole leadership role built up in 2 just suddenly doesn’t exist. Even with all of this, if Woody had gone back to Bonnie it would have made more sense. He lives in the closest, occasionally gets played with, still sees his friends, develops a new community of old toys, and accepts that his time has passed and is at peace. Done. Woody is now an elder.

I don’t know. It was an enjoyable movie, but I really think it was not a good addition to the story and actively hampers the messaging of 1-3. 

I guess if there’s money to be made, though…

Alyx07_07,My ex greeted me this Christmas ,"My ex and I broke up not long ago. It was a messy breakup to say the least. He talks in a way that makes me feel like he never did anything wrong in the relationship. He claims so much misinformation that defending any of it is futile. I had to disengage and acted like I never knew him. He was really persistent for the next couple of weeks. Calling, texting and going to my house to beg me to comeback. 

One of the biggest reasons I had broken up because as I got to know him, it was clear to me that I don’t see myself marrying this man. He just doesn’t get me the way I get myself. And whenever I ask him to do something nice for me (like taking me into planned dates and giving me flowers) , it goes dismissed. Like all I’m asking for is too much. He also never really verbally asked me out to be his girlfriend. I think I went with it too much. 

After a month of no contact, on Christmas day and he greeted me a Merry Christmas. I said it back. Then he started asking me if this specific instagram was mine. I said No and he said “Really?.” I assured him then he segued into telling me that he still hates me for ignoring him. The only thing left of him is hatred, I presumably undermined all of his efforts. And that it meant nothing for me to leave him like that but he still cant forget me.

I can’t physically talk to him anymore because he is so good at twisting the situation. He makes me vulnerable. So what can I do in this situation?

freemahboi,Are women more likely attracted to other women,I come from a country where same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ are banned. Occasionally when i see certain women especially the ones with large brests and curvy hips I get turned on. And I don't know if this is the result of media portrayal of women. My chest is flat af and I look like an adolescent boy thanks to crappy genetic makeup. And maybe that's part of the reason why I'm attracted to other women with more defined bodies?? I honestly don't know...all I can say is I occasionally get an urge to kiss on my roommate's neck and carass her soft breasts. And then smell her shampooed blond hair. She's attractive and I'm trying my best to stay calm and neutral. Does anyone struggle with similar issue?

zooms400,Sad disgusted? Nipple syndrome,"I did some googling and found out about the existence of sad nipple syndrome. I have, for as long as I can remember, had a similar experience wrt my nipples being touched by anyone or anything including myself. It was extremely validating seeing that others have similar experiences and now I’d love to hear from others who relate.
For me the feeling isn’t sadness, though. The best way I can describe it maybe is repulsion. Like it’s a viscerally nauseating feeling, disgust. A decent comparison would be like eyeballs being touched. When partners have touched my nipples during sex in the past there were times when I forced myself to tolerate it as much as I could just because I was we young and scared to communicate; it was awful. At some point I started explaining to partners that I just hate it. Which most people have a hard time understanding and some people have a hard time respecting. 
I’ve always hated that I’m so bothered by it, if I could choose to not have this reaction I would without a doubt, but wow it’s a relief learning that it’s not just me. ",2024-12-25 05:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1hlu8yz/sad_disgusted_nipple_syndrome/,women,False
New-Section-9827,I gave him everything but it was not enough,"I (25F) was dating a guy (26M) for about 8 months. He always used to tell me that he saw me as a life partner and that his whole life changed after he met me.
He made me feel really loved in the first few months too.
Then he told me he was moving countries to find a job and study and wanted me to go with him. Me being an idiot actually thought about quitting my job and following him to whatever country he was going to because I was so in love.
Then he started taking me for granted and dates became far and few. He is unemployed but was ""too busy"" to answer my calls or to go out on dates. He started treating me more like a hookup than a girlfriend and started gaslighting me whenever i brought it up.
Then he told me one day all of a sudden that he cant do long distance. But he refused to breakup like a mature adult. So i ended things because i was done with all the manipulation and gaslighting.
And he still guilt tripped me about it.
Ever since i started dating him my friends were telling me I was too good for him and he doesnt deserve so many chances.
But I was a fool in love, oblivious to all the lying and manipulation.

munchiesz101,pregnancy feels violent,"First of all, I’m aware that the things I’m going to write are not logical, they are based on what I feel but I know it isn’t very connected with reality.

I feel like pregnancy is violent against me, as a woman. I know it isn’t a real form of violence and is just a natural process, but if a boyfriend, for example, wants me to get pregnant and doesn’t consider adoption, my reaction is to think something like “why do you WANT me to go through all this pain? Why do you want me to be in pain for nine months, and experience the worst pain of my life to give birth? Knowing all the possible complications such as post-partum depression, post-partum anxiety, psychosis, irreversible back pain, joint problems, or even death”

As I pointed, it upsets me that he, on purpose, wants to inflict that kind of things on me, and, in that sense, it feels unfair that I have all the biological burdens (I know it’s some people’s dream, and for them it’s a blessing, and that’s why I’m speaking solely of my thoughts about it).

It feels so unfair that a man would want me to go trough all this pain WHILE HE FEELS NOTHING. Feels so violent, even if it’s just nature. I’m not mad at anyone in specific, maybe just questioning the universe.

Electrical_Cress7294,Is it bad I look at porn or participate in very mild bdsm? I need opinions from women who aren't raging against porn or bdsm please. ,"
I am a lesbian and I look at Yuri hentai and bondage hentai. I was told that even if it's drawn it's still exploitive and disgusting.

I was told that wanting to be restrained by bondage I was unwell and held internalized misogyny. That I must have unresolved trauma. But I've never been tied up and traumatized. I've been abused by an ex but I worked through that. I didn't engage in bdsm until I met my wife. But I was into it before I met that abusive ex. 

It's just I was told I can't be a real feminist if I engage in this form of sexual expression. They said sex is about love, trust, and communication. But the thing is that's literally what happens between my wife and I when we engage in bdsm.

 And we don't do anything dangerous or that out there. Nothing like choking or pain. Maybe some candle wax that's low burning so it just feels warm and spanking. That is as close to pain as it gets. Everything else is me showing my dedication through acts of service. Like serving her dinner after she gets off work. Or rubbing her sore feet. Those are the examples I can think of right now.

They said my wife is a misogynist because she makes me do this stuff. She isn't making me do anything. It was all my idea in the first place. Then they act dubious when I explain it was my idea and insist I was groomed to do sex work for my wife.",2024-12-24 20:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1hllmnh/is_it_bad_i_look_at_porn_or_participate_in_very/,women,False

Now, back to the topic at hand. I was born in 2000 and raised on the Treasure Coast and for as long as I can remember, a Florida winter truly felt like winter. Sure, it didn’t really snow down here much, but I remember it getting down into the 30s and on several occasions the 20s in the winter down here. Hell, my parents told me that the NWS used to give hard freeze warnings down here when they were growing up down here all the time. I’ve even heard of instances where my parents would come out during the winter and have their hoses frozen. 

Nowadays, the only times I see it get down into the 30s or below here are when the occasional cold front or bomb cyclone comes through town. Everyone I’ve ever talked to besides my immediate family who has lived here for any length of time has told me that Im imagining things or misremembering the past.

woelffee,How to break into the A&E space as a manufacturer?,"Hi All,

My company is tasking me with growing our market share in the Architectural and Engineering space. However, I know very little about it. Any advice on the best way to do this? Here are some questions on the top of my mind:
1. How often are architects deciding specifications for certain products? Or is that more led by the customer?
2. Do y’all make money on selling our products? Our normal business is channel-driven but it seems like things would go to bid vs architects taking margin.
3. What do y’all look for when deciding a certain product? Is it client wishes/value/price?

Arktikos02,Some tips for writing for prisoners,"# Some basics 

First thing, look up the rules for the prison itself. Every prison is a little different and so each person will have their own rules about sending things like letters and packages so make sure you do your research before sending anything. This is important because anytime you mess up at best it means that the package or delivery will just be sent back and at worst it could mean that the prisoner themselves could be punished. At worst worst you could be punished but very unlikely unless of course you send something illegal. So do some research into the prison and their rules, they have rules so look them up.

# Letters 

Letters are the most basic thing you can send and letters are fun to get. You should know that prisoners often when they send letters back they have to send it with their own post stamps and those cost money inside the prison so if you don't get a message back it's nothing personal it's probably just because they can't afford it, they're too busy, or they have too many letters to respond to. But that is okay. You should also know that prison guards typically remove the envelope and the letter from each other because they have to open the letter and read it themselves first. This causes some problems such as the fact that the envelope gets separated meaning that anything you write on the envelope will not be necessarily given to the prisoner. If you want to return address put it in the letter itself. If you send anything like photographs, make sure to number all of the photographs and then in the letter itself inventory all of the photographs. When it comes to the letters number the letters like this ""\#\# out of [total]"" this is so they know how many letters there were total and what number the letter currently is. This is so if the letters ever get lost which if they're read by the guards they might the prisoner will know which letters are missing. It's helpful because they could try to petition to have them. Check the rules of the prison as I already said because sometimes there are different rules about the restrictions on letters. Sometimes these restrictions make no sense but they have to be followed anyway. Restrictions on color, restrictions on whether or not you can print on both sides of a page, the number of pages you can send total, all of these things could be restrictions depending on the prison. Check the rules first.

# Etiquette 

When it comes to letter etiquette there are also different rules to follow. The first thing is do not talk about the crime that they had committed. Don't do that. First off if they have not been sentenced yet and are still awaiting trial then it could be a problem for them. Don't do it it puts them in a weird position. Second even if they do get charged it's still a really weird position to put them in because it's very personal as well as the fact that they may not want to talk about it. If they want to talk about it then that's different but don't ask them about it. Instead talk about other things. It's okay to talk about other stuff about the prison, you don't need to pretend that they're not prisoners but don't talk about their crime, and don't talk about any other illegal activity either. Remember, anything you say will be read by the guards. This is also one of the reasons why when you send letters it will take a while for them be able to be read by the prisoner because they have to be read by the guards and if your letter is 1 in 1000 letters, it's going to take a while. 

# Packages 

Who doesn't love a surprise package? Prisoners. The thing is is that surprises are not really the best thing for prisoners. You because when you surprise a prisoner you end up typically actually surprising the guards. Prisoners can be punished for things like the books that you send or the the gifts that you give. If you want to give a gift sometimes there are organizations out there that are things like books behind bars or some kind of organization like that and they are dedicated to providing approved books to prisoners. There are probably organizations out there to help give approved to gifts for prisoners.

# Phone calls

When it comes to LM it's very unlikely that you'll be able to call him however when it comes to other prisoners you may be interested in corresponding with, prisoners typically have a call list and they will put people on that call list. The prisoner can put people on that call list such as family and friends. If you're not on the list you will not be approved when you call the prison. If you are not on the call list or they don't put you on the call list don't take it personally, it's because they don't have space or they're trying to save that space for someone else. Also they have to pay for their own minutes. 

# Money 

Okay maybe you want to give money to LM instead. Maybe he could use it to buy things. That's a nice thing to do but the problem is is that one there is a cap on the amount of money that you can put on someone's books which means account but also don't give them too much money because if a prisoner has too much money they can end up being a Target in prison because once it starts getting around that person has a lot of money they could be targeted by other prisoners to essentially try to give them things. And the thing is that at least in the US male prisons are especially violent. A lot more than female prisons apparently. So yeah probably don't put money on people's accounts without asking.

# Other 

I don't really know where to put this information but I also just want to share some personal experience that I have when it comes to how restrictive the rules for sending letters can be sometimes. When I was involved in a different political movement and there were people who were arrested on bogus charges relating to the violation of their civil rights, and this was happening in Atlanta Georgia, restrictions involved requiring special USPS postal paper. So it had to be pre-stamped postal paper from USPS and it couldn't be anything else. It was really that restrictive. This meant that if you didn't send a letter on that little piece of paper that was no bigger than a napkin folded mind you, and it had a pre-printed stamp on so they were prepaid, then the prison would not accept it. Do I think that they made this rule specifically to make it harder to send to those prisoners? Absolutely, I absolutely think so. That was not a normal rule and I know that for the most part when it comes to sending letters to prisoners that rule is not in place. If you go on to websites to write to prisoners you will not find that rule. That was a rule that I believe they implemented because of the nature of those people. So watch out.",2024-12-24 02:10:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hl3dvo/some_tips_for_writing_for_prisoners/,Anarchism,False

sleepy_din0saur,I'm disabled and disadvantaged. How do I make a difference?,"I'm a budding anarchist. After years of feeling politically homeless, I have realized my ideals align with anarchism. 

I've always had so much desire to make a change or some sort of positive impact. But all of the literature I've found so far assume that I, the reader, am abled and have access to resources.

I suffer from ADHD, autism, depression, PTSD, and all of the other comorbidities associated with those conditions. I am mostly able-bodied, but the aforementioned disabilities... well... Disable me.

I've finished schooling and have a college degree. But I've never been employed before. I have no source of income other than SSI and the sporadic art commission. I can't drive and public transport doesn't really exist in Indiana. The area I live is not walkable, either.

I have a teenie tiny online audience and I do my best to spread awareness when I can. But I want to take action, I'm tired of just sitting and being aware. I donate a portion of the proceeds from my big commissions to Palestinian and disaster relief charities. I call my representatives and senators. I offer my voice of support and donate what I can to folks in need. I create erotic art as an act of protest, passion, and defiance. 

I want to do more. Can I do more given my circumstances? Or is what I'm currently doing good enough? I get caught up in feeling hopeless when I step back and look at the big picture.

Thank you if you've read this far!

Puzzleheaded_Tree290,Question for anyone here living in Greece ,"Olay, I posted on another sub about this before and it was helpful but I'm wanting to know more about public perception. My boyfriend is a Greek citizen, living in the UK, and is expected to come over to greece and serve three months in the military next year. His immediate reaction was ""Go fuck yourself, I don't even live here and you're expecting to use me.""

We *are aware* of the 30 day limit draft dodgers can visit Greece for. But his granny is wuite sick. He's afraid of going over, staying over the limit then getting drafted. The best bet is getting an i5, probably either by faking something or exaggerating an existing condition.

What we want to know is: Has the government really clamped down on draft dodgers? I know [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/33810/an-ailing-military-draft-system/&ved=2ahUKEwjW7d-a1r2KAxUJWEEAHeBKFh84ChAWegQIDRAB&usg=AOvVaw3DZ8jC6OlBoNBJbD0YC76h) article circulated years ago about a planned crackdown, but we don't know if that was ever enforced. Anecdotally, some people say getting exempt has become very easy, I have yet to hear about it being that hard. And how many people actually avoid it? I had heard that the Greek army has about a hundred thousand conscripts, my boyfriend heard that number and it frightened the shit out of him. But official numbers are less than half of that. Basically, right now he's worried about the ease of it and to the lesser extent, the social stigma.

I know this is a weird question to ask on an anarchist sub but I avoided the Greek sub because I don't speak Greek, obviously, and have to type through a translator, which I'm sure is frustrating for people reading it.",2024-12-23 10:29:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hkl0il/question_for_anyone_here_living_in_greece/,Anarchism,False

Significant_Slip7940,K-3 vs CR-1 processing times,"Hello folks,

I have done some googling and reading and it is my understanding that the intent of K-3 is for the spouses to be together sooner in the US, while the I-130 is getting approved.

It is my understanding that in both cases the claiming spouse in the US at first needs to file the I-130 form with the USCIS. Once USCIS notifies that it has received the I-130, then the claiming spouse files form I-129F.

Then both forms get to NVC and it’s up to NVC which one gets approved first. If the I-129F approves first, then the spouse from abroad can already go to the US embassy and move to the US to wait for the I-130 approval.

But, it’s very much possible that the I-130 will get processed by the NVC faster and then the I-129F becomes irrelevant.

So here’s my question, does K-3 potentially speed up the time for the spouses to be together? What’s the downside of K-3, other than it’s more expensive?

Are there other downsides? Would appreciate if people tell me about their experiences!",2024-12-25 12:03:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1hlzk0q/k3_vs_cr1_processing_times/,immigration,False
Status_Ad9199,When should I enter the US on L-1B?,"Hi all,

I realize this might be a silly question, but my L-1B was recently approved on a blanket L1 petition from my employer in the US with the I-797 date from September 2023.

My start date is in mid January 2025, and I plan to enter 2 days prior to get settled in. The only guideline I am aware of is that you should not enter more than 10 days before the start date on the I-797 notice of action.

So everything should be fine, right? Also, am I expected to bring my offer letter with the start date to the CBP officer at the port of entry when I enter?

RhubarbWinter4971,Seeking guidance regarding my situation. ,"So I am an international student in Canada. I have applied for a B1/B2 visa in Canada( I am not canadian. I am from Ivory Coast/Côte D’Ivoire) to go visit some relatives in the US. 
I received a waiver for the interview( I used to study in the US on a F-1 visa until 2023 and even work on OPT until August on this year). 

But I am facing a situation that makes me anxious:

So in canada, I just finished the semester( my first semester in my new school) and I failed 2 of the 3 courses I have taken ( the first time something like that ever happened to me. Went to community college, complete my undergraduate degree at University and a master in another one and never experienced this before). 

I am considering withdrawing from the school altogether because it is a wake up call that I am too old for that( I am 25 year old) and should keep it moving in « the real world »( I mean look for another job). Also, with these two grades, I lost my scholarship and I can’t afford the tuition with something like that. 

I technically didn’t receive any notifications from the school( not on probation nor anything else). But I am seriously considering withdrawing from the school. 

The issue is the information I gave to the US embassy. Does withdrawing from school will impact my visa decision ? Because technically I am still enrolled for the next semester and will probably be during the entire period they are processing my visa. But as soon as I withdraw from school, I will lose my canadian visa and therefore I will need to leave the territory. Which is normal. But I want to know if it will impact the us visa decision.  Which is what matters to me. Because the informations I gave won’t be up to date at the time of the processing. 

What should I do moving forward ? 
Or should I scrap the whole interview process and start from my home country ?",2024-12-25 10:42:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1hlyiyy/seeking_guidance_regarding_my_situation/,immigration,False

ElMeroFriki,I’ve seen similar questions asked here so I’ll ask: can I apply for dual citizenship (Mexico) if I only have one parent’s birth certificate?,"I was born in the US so I am an American citizen. I was looking into getting Mexican citizenship. Both parents were born in Mexico. I recently had a falling out with my family so I am only in possession of my mother’s birth certificate and don’t think I can get much more. 

I was trying to get my Father’s birth certificate but we were not able to because his mother didn’t register him with the correct date of birth (or at least the one he uses), and what he did have in his possession, was literally just the corner that had part of his name.

I read something about needing a marriage certificate too. Yeah, probably won’t be getting that. Unless there is a way to somehow access that the same way I was able to get my mom’s birth certificate? I just needed her name and date of birth.

I was wondering if anyone was able to get their dual citizenship with only one parent’s birth certificate proving she’s a Mexican citizen.

I know I can just call the consulate and ask but I’m at work and it’s a holiday, and I’m dying to know now lol.",2024-12-25 10:03:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1hly1dc/ive_seen_similar_questions_asked_here_so_ill_ask/,immigration,False

Proof-Specific5229,Can I Transit Through the UK Without a Visa? (Indian Passport with U.S. and Canada Visas),"Hi everyone,

I need some advice regarding a transit situation. I'm traveling soon with the following itinerary:

* **Delhi (DEL) → London Heathrow (LHR)** on Air India
* **London Heathrow (LHR) → Newark (EWR)** on United Airlines
* **Newark (EWR) → Toronto (YYZ)** on United Airlines

# Key Points:

* I hold an **Indian passport**.
* I have **valid U.S. and Canada tourist visas**.
* All my flights are on the **same day**.
* I’m unsure if Air India will check my baggage through to Toronto, as I’m switching airlines in London. If they don’t, I may need to collect and recheck my luggage at Heathrow.

# My Concerns:

1. Can I **transit airside** in the UK without a visa under the Transit Without Visa (TWOV) scheme?
2. If I need to collect and recheck my luggage (landsid transit), will I require a **Visitor in Transit Visa**?

I’ve checked the UKVI website, and it seems I meet the TWOV requirements if I stay airside (valid U.S. visa, confirmed onward tickets, departing same day). However, if I need to go landside, TWOV won’t apply, and a transit visa might be needed.

# Question:

Air India Support was not very helpful when I asked if they can check my baggage through to Toronto. Apart from the UKVI website, **where is the best place to call and confirm this information**? Should I contact Heathrow Airport, the British High Commission in India, or someone else?

Any guidance or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

","April is Black Women History Month. Currently, there is an online exhibition of the visual and literary memoirs of American prison artist C-Note, ""Black Shero: C-Note Celebrates Black Women History Month."" It features a 25 year plus, body of work, uplifting and advocating for Black women. 



One such visual uplifting work was the 2009 drawing, ""Colored Girl."" Later, in 2015, he would create the Andy Warhol inspired ""Colored Girl Warholed,"" the Black response to Warhol's 1962, ""Four Marilyns."" In 2021, during the worst of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 pandemic, founder-owner Anna D. Smith of the Silicon Valley based Anna D. Smith Fine Art and Real Estate Broker curated the ""'Look Up!' 2, Hope & Beauty"" billboard art exhibition. 



Smith, also known as the ""Queen of the Underground Art World,"" wanted to uplift spirits; especially in light of the fact, pandemic health restrictions prevented the public from having access to museums or galleries. It featured ""Colored Girl Warholed,"" as a solo work at the entrance of Santana Row, the exclusive high end retail and residential district of the Silicon Valley.



One such literary work of note, was the article, ""THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN VOICES IN STRUGGLE: Emphasis on the Black Woman’s Voice."" It provides a never again mindset, from insights by Black Panther leaders Angela Y. Davis and Elaine Brown of the patriarchy that had existed amongst their organization. A similar theme could be heard from women participants during the civil rights movement.



Besides great works of art, there are poems, sound recordings and videos.

Obviously I'm not going full blown Stars and Stripes but I still want to honor my ancestors and the heritage I come from. I'm not sure how to do this and was seeking your advice. 

When I look online the best advice I see is to incorporate a kente cloth dress or shirt, a dashiki, a pair of African print pants, a head-wrap, a pair of sandals..

CranberryFun3740,SUNDOG_TRX an internet and crypto phenomenon,"Like many great ideas, SUNDOG\_TRX was born from the internet culture and inspired by the rise of meme coins. The term ""sundog"" refers to a rare and beautiful natural phenomenon: bright spots appear on either side of the sun, forming an almost magical image in the sky. It’s often seen as a sign of positivity and good luck, which became a core theme for the creators of the SUNDOG coin.

Launched in 2024, SUNDOG\_TRX was designed to be more than just a fun coin with a quirky mascot. The team behind SUNDOG\_TRX saw an opportunity to inject some light-heartedness into the often severe and volatile world of cryptocurrency. At the same time, they wanted to build a project that had real value for its community — both in terms of financial potential and in doing good for the world.

SUNDOG’s creators were inspired by the success of other meme coins like Dogecoin but aimed to add their twist: positivity, inclusivity, and a commitment to giving back. This combination of humor and a clear purpose helped SUNDOG stand out early on, drawing in investors and meme lovers alike.

https://preview.redd.it/o3y0tu923p8e1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6776d6379bb875e3c03321f58cdc58f15e1fd918

# What Makes SUNDOG_TRX Special?

Several factors make SUNDOG stand out in a crowded meme coin landscape:

1. **Community-Driven Focus**: Unlike meme coins that can feel like a one-way street, with developers pushing out content and investors just waiting for price changes, SUNDOG thrives on community involvement. The creators invite their users to contribute ideas and participate in the coin’s growth. From marketing campaigns to decisions about future projects, SUNDOG is as much about its community as it is about the coin itself.
2. **Good Vibes**: SUNDOG isn’t just about making money — it’s about positivity. The coin is built around inclusivity and spreading good energy, which resonates with a broad audience. People feel good being a part of it, and that feel-good factor keeps them engaged.
3. T**okenomics That Reward Holders**: SUNDOG’s tokenomics are designed to benefit long-term holders. A portion of every transaction gets redistributed to existing holders, meaning the longer you hold SUNDOG, the more you’re rewarded. This encourages people to stay involved rather than flipping the coin for short-term gains.
4. **Charitable Giving**: Right from the start, SUNDOG made it clear that doing good was a part of its DNA. The project set aside a significant portion of its token supply for charitable causes, focusing on environmental preservation and animal welfare. This alignment with meaningful causes gives the project extra depth beyond being “the next meme coin.”
5. **Distinctive Branding**: Let’s be honest — part of what makes a meme coin successful is its recognition, and SUNDOG nailed its branding. The sunny, dog-themed logo, paired with positive messaging, is simple, catchy, and memorable, crucial in a market full of contenders vying for attention.

SUNDOG\_TRX Meme Coin is much more than just a passing trend. It’s a community-driven project that combines humor, positivity, and real-world impact in a way that resonates deeply with its holders. From its unique origin story to its ambitious plans for the future, SUNDOG\_TRX has captured the attention of meme lovers and crypto investors.

ElvisIsNotDjed,Could Decentralized Cloud Be the Next Big Thing?,"With the rapid growth of Web3, the conversation around infrastructure is heating up. Decentralized cloud services are emerging as an alternative to centralized providers like AWS, promising greater resilience and lower costs.

One such project, Impossible Cloud Network (ICN), is working on decentralized solutions for storage and compute, using blockchain technology to power its network. By incentivizing node operators, they aim to create a scalable, distributed infrastructure that aligns with Web3 values.

What caught my attention is the potential for real-world adoption—decentralized cloud could support everything from DeFi and dApps to DAOs and beyond. But like any emerging tech, there are risks and hurdles to overcome.

Could projects like ICN represent a moonshot in the making, or is decentralized cloud still too early?

RanaKozu,$Hippo Memecoin: The Rising Gem on the SUI Blockchain,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to memecoins, yet $Hippo is setting itself apart as a standout contender on the SUI blockchain. With its engaging branding and strong community presence, $Hippo is capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and meme lovers alike.

# Why $Hippo Stands Out

$Hippo’s uniqueness stems from its perfect fusion of humor, innovation, and strategic development on the SUI blockchain. Renowned for its scalable and efficient infrastructure, SUI provides $Hippo with a robust foundation, ensuring seamless transactions and minimal fees. This technological edge positions $Hippo as a leader in the memecoin space.

Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on hype, $Hippo combines playful branding with meaningful utilities to ensure long-term relevance. Its focus on creativity and engagement has cultivated a loyal global following that continues to grow.

# The Path to a $1 Billion Market Cap

What truly excites the crypto community is $Hippo’s ambition to reach a $1 billion market cap. Backed by consistent growth and an engaged community, this goal feels increasingly attainable. The team’s transparency, strategic updates, and active partnerships instill confidence in holders, further solidifying its position in the market.

# Bridging Memes and Utility

Memecoins have evolved from purely entertainment-focused assets to significant players in the crypto ecosystem. They bridge the gap between blockchain technology and mainstream audiences, making the world of crypto more approachable.

$Hippo exemplifies this transition. While it embraces its meme-inspired roots, the project is also committed to delivering real-world value. By leveraging the fast and scalable SUI blockchain, $Hippo ensures a user-friendly experience that aligns with its mission of fun, accessibility, and innovation.

# Looking Ahead

As $Hippo continues to gain traction, its strong community remains the driving force behind its success. For anyone seeking a memecoin with scalability, ambitious goals, and a dynamic community, $Hippo on the SUI blockchain is one to watch.

With the right momentum, $Hippo could become a top-tier contender in the crypto market.

**Think about it:** traditional cloud storage providers like Google Drive and Dropbox are convenient, but they come with some obvious downsides high costs, scalability issues, and major concerns about privacy and data ownership. Decentralized storage seems like it could solve a lot of these problems.  
  
**For example**, I’ve read about networks like [Züs ](https://zus.network/?v=1)that offer decentralized storage with some cool twists:  
  
**Privacy:** Your data is encrypted end-to-end, and you're the only one holding the keys. No one else can access or tamper with your files.  
**Passive Income:** Instead of just paying for storage, you can actually earn by staking tokens or renting out storage capacity.  
Scalability Without Breaking the Bank: Costs stay manageable as you grow.  
One of the things that really caught my eye was the integration of Real-World Assets into DeFi platforms. Instead of everything being purely digital, RWAs bring a real-world backing that adds some much-needed stability and legitimacy.  
  
Another interesting feature I came across was dual-device security: transactions require approval from both your mobile and your laptop. It seems like a smart way to add an extra layer of protection without making things overly complicated.  
  
I'm curious do any of you use decentralized storage? How do you see it evolving? And how important is data privacy and earning potential when it comes to choosing a platform?  
  
Would love to hear your thoughts or recommendations on projects doing this right.

Gedet27,How CUDOS Intercloud address AI GPU's gap,"AI and DePIN have both been hot trending narratives in Web3 since 2023, with AI at a 30 billion market cap and DePIN at 23 billion currently

However, there's limited storage capacity to scale 

Let's look at how DePINs like r/Cudos_Official address AI's GPUs gap.

In the AI tech stack, DePIN networks provide utility to AI through computing resources. The GPU shortage caused by the development of large tech companies has caused other developers who are building their own AI models to lack sufficient GPUs for compute

This often leads to developers opting for centralized cloud providers but causes inefficiencies from having to sign inflexible long-term contracts for high-performance hardware. 

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) like r/Cudos_Official Intercloud can be used to aggregate underutilized enterprise GPUs and put them to use, redistributing previously inaccessible supply back into the market
These approaches democratize the supply and access to computational resources, challenging traditional GPU monopolies and fostering innovation.
It also ensures that unused computational power can contribute to significant AI projects.

theband3rdShift,Looking to make a music video ,"Hi my name is Dylan and my music projects name is called 3rd Shift. I released a debut album in sept. titled “Choices In Life”. 

I am going to use the song “In My Head” for my first music video. 

I am looking for a videographer looking to build their portfolio. I am also looking for a makeup artist familiar with special effects.it’s going to look like  brain surgery is being performed in the main scenes but I will be awake singing the lyrics. I am looking for actors and extras for a party scene and the hospital scenes. I’d like to shoot this video in April or May 2025 in one day. I will be collecting props. If someone has a location they think would work or any ideas I am down to listen to them all. Some of the props needed include hospital operating table or something to use similar. Some hospital props like a iv holder and a light for the operation. I would like to make it look as authentic as possible. The story line is a party scene in the opening with guest drinking and drugging the house is a wreck. Then it transitions to the morning and I am on the couch everyone is passed out and the camera pans to the tv and then it goes to a the hospital were i am in brain surgery getting the bullshit cut out of my head. I act a little wild in this video as I awake in the surgery and walk in the hospital with my head cut open. This will be cut with scenes of me playing the guitar on the operating table and on the roof where I eventually go to. The end of the video follows the song I throw away the trash and alcohol and I start a new day a new me.

Late-Economics-1497,"Breaking news, Max agrees on term limits","Yes, I’m trying to use a picture of my cute dog to get you to read this because I think it’s important

We is North Carolina citizens need to ask three questions first why are there no term limits second why is it winter take all with the electoral college and third why do people who don’t live in North Carolina get fund campaigns for North Carolina elected positions.
 
So on my mind, I have found a problem and you shouldn’t find a problem without a solution 

Here are my three solutions 

One 
    win, the district win the vote amend the state constitution so that if you win the electoral district you win the electoral vote. Just like Nebraska and Maine. You split the electoral votes by district.

Two
     Amend the state constitution to state you may represent the state of North Carolina for a total of 12 years. It does not matter in what capacity you represent the state of North Carolina if you were voted in to represent the state of North Carolina, if you were voted in to represent a district inside the state of North Carolina, basically, if you find yourself on a ballot and it has something to do with the state, not the county and not the municipal level you get a total of 12 years that’s it if you wanna be president you can be president that’s President of the United States of America if you do 8+12 that’s 20 not that I believe anyone should be in politics that long but there you go

Three
      A campaign cannot be funded by anyone that cannot vote on that position. Example, if I’m running for the 13th district volunteer tribute of North Carolina at the federal or state level to be a representative I cannot take a contribution to help fund my campaign from anybody that is not a registered voter in the 13th district of North Carolina that means I can’t take money from a business. I can’t take money from a corporation from a super pack. I can’t take money from a millionaire in Arizona. I can only take money to fund my campaign from those, I am supposed to represent.

I really hope this makes sense to everyone. If it doesn’t please by all means ask me if you have a better idea or would like to improve upon my ideas please let me know. I really want to see these three ideas start making traction. Start getting people asking questions so that maybe we can get our elected officials to hold themselves accountable and do these things or we can elect some one term people that are just looking to give the government back to the people it only take one state if North Carolina does these three things does two of these three things one of these three things other states will follow in sooner than later we the people will again have the power

RevolutionaryCar5668,How to increase conviction in your Salah?,"Assalam Walaikum everyone. I was just seeking some advice from people regarding our prayers. 

I am someone who recently (1.5-2 months) started praying again and started to improve and increase my faith after a long time of being away from my deen. Alhamdulillah it’s come back to me with Allah’s will and I don’t miss a prayer. 

However I started to notice while praying my mind does tend to wander off to worldly things. Nothing too concerning. Just worldly problems I maybe facing or even conversation I need to have with people, or what I have to do later in the day. You know just your everyday normal stuff that one tends to ponder on. 

I want to pray without these wordly things distracting me. Like I want my 100% focus on the Salah. I even try to pray as if Allah is in front of me. I try to read the prayers out loud so I am focused. However I still fail to keep my 100% focus. Like I know I read the Surahs and Tasbeehs correctly however I feel like this isn’t my best prayer because my mind is still not focused on my Rabb in front of me. 

Any advice on how to make my conviction stronger. To keep my focus 100% on the Salah. ",2024-12-25 09:33:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1hlxo5u/how_to_increase_conviction_in_your_salah/,islam,False

Own_Ad2224,Tawakkul — The story of Moses (pbuh),"You know Moses (pbuh), one of the greatest messengers to have ever been sent?

One of the 5 elite prophets who Allah (swt) described as “the people of determination”? 

Do you know how he started his Journey and ended it?

At the beginning when Allah (swt) revealed his mission to him and ordered him and his brother to go to Firaun. 

2 brothers who had **nothing** but Allah (swt) was ordered to go to a ruler the likes which has never been seen before.

Understandably, they were afraid. They said, 

**“Our Lord, indeed we are afraid that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress.”. [Ṭā-Hā, Ayah 45]**

They couldn’t fathom how two people that had nothing could possibly go against a whole kingdom. 

But Allah (swt) taught Moses and Harun (pbut) then and there, the concept of **Tawakkul**. In the following verse, [Allāh] said:

**“Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see.” [Ṭā-Hā, Ayah 45]**

Allah (swt) is teaching them, and by extension every single human being until the day of judgement, that when Allah (swt) is with you NOTHING can overcome you!

With this lesson engraved in their souls they went ahead and delivered the message to the accursed Firaun. 

This was the start of the journey, but do you know how it was concluded?

Picture this, death is EVERYWHERE. In front of you is the Red sea. 

Behind you is the whole army of Firaun that would reach you at any moment.

The people of Moses (pbuh) fell into despair, as Allah (swt) mentioned in the Quran. 

**“And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, Indeed, we are to be overtaken!”. [Ash-Shuʿarāʾ, Ayah 61]**

Imagine the fear, anxiety, sadness and despair. What could they possibly do? 

Firauns elite soldiers are in front of them and the Red Sea is behind them. 

**Death** is literally in front of their eyes and there’s seemingly nowhere to escape.

They started to run towards Moses, crying out, despairing and surrendering to the reality in front of their eyes.

But what was Moses (pbuh) reaction? What did he do?

Remember the important lesson that Allah (swt) taught him in the beginning? 

That if you completely rely upon Allah (swt) and submit to him, nothing will overcome you? 

In the beginning, the very thought of going up against Firaun scared him to his core. 

But now, when faced with death and the full force of Firauns elite soldiers, what was his reaction?

**“[Moses] said, No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me.” [Ash-Shuʿarāʾ, Ayah 62]**

No to despair, no to death and no to giving up.

My Lord is with me and even though I may not see a way out with my own eyes, my Lord who’s all seeing and all powerful WILL make a way out for me.

At that moment, when Moses displayed this extraordinary level of reliance and Twakkul in Allah (swt) when faced with impossible odds, the help of Allah (swt) descended in a way that **no one could have EVER imagined!**

**“Then We inspired to Moses, Strike with your staff the sea, and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.” [Ash-Shuʿarāʾ, Ayah 63]**

The vast sea that sealed their way of escape was now parted. Each portion became as **enormous as a mountain.**

Allah (swt) enabled Moses (pbuh) and his people to walk through it safely and secure. 

And He drowned Firaun and his army.

Demonstrating to the whole world that Allah (swt) is with those who believe and rely upon Him.

What do we learn from this?

- Tawakkul is from the best of things you could do
- It’s a process. You’ll feel fear in the beginning but your heart will gradually shift from fear to tranquility whenever faced with adversity.
- When you are faced with a situation in which you see no escape. When you have no idea how you’re going to deal with it. If you decide at that moment to **completely submit to Allah (swt) alone** and display an unshakable reliance in Allah (swt). He will split the seas for you! 

It’s important to learn that Tawakkul is a journey. 

So, what could I do in my daily life to improve my Tawakkul?

No human being is void of stress, worry, fear, sadness, despair or uncertainty. 

Whenever you heart falls into one of these emotions, TRAIN it to instantly seek refuge in Allah (swt) and rely upon him ALONE.

Say **“Hasbiyallahu Wa Ni’mal Wakeel”.** 

Meaning, “Allah (alone) is sufficient for me and he (alone) is the best disposer of affairs”. 

And try to have full faith that whatever you’re going through, Allah (swt) will make a way out for you.

Through this, you’re always trying to connect your heart to Allah (swt) alone. 

And it could be a small thing. For instance, a job interview that’s making you nervous or a school presentation you’re stressed about.

Or a marriage meeting that's making you sleep deprived.

Whatever it is, no matter how small or big it is, whenever you feel one of these emotions, Instantly remind yourself that Allah (swt) is aware of you, sufficient for you and that He will guide you through it!

Doing this will train your heart and mind to always remember and stay connected to Allah (swt)!

You will, Insha Allah, realize one day the effect of this.

When faced with adversities, when everyone is panicking, worried and have lost all hope.

You're at **peace**. Knowing that the one who hears and sees EVERYTHING is with you!",2024-12-25 12:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1hlzrzm/tawakkul_the_story_of_moses_pbuh/,islam,False

My fellow Redditors, I'm a solo developer seeking help to promote my meme coins without relying on influencers, who I believe have already done enough harm to the trading community. Here's what I've come up with:

$[WOLOSR](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/7FaTcQDZyqQmamQRQcKFGjLYwxTdSzQz9bt1W7Myioxj/) (WorldofLosers): This meme coin is deeply personal to me, reflecting on the mistakes we all make. It's for the everyday person, the underdogs, and anyone who can chuckle at their life's missteps. 

$[Pukecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/FH2e8M3x8GrCXZ375f5bjm2efUtQNme8rizU3G5WmU7b/): With the existence of Fartcoin and Shitcoin, I figured Pukecoin was a natural addition. It initially caught some attention but needs more trading volume to keep the momentum going.

DifferentRice2146,Risy DAO Innovative or Not?,"Hi All! 

I recently came across Risy DAO, and I wanted to share my thoughts and get your perspective on it. For those who might not have heard of it, Risy DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Polygon blockchain. What caught my attention is their innovative approach to tackling issues like centralization, whale manipulation, and unfair token distribution.

Here are a few things I really like about the project:

* **10% Daily Transfer Limit**: This creates a 10:1 buy-to-sell ratio, which they claim ensures a continuous bull market. It’s an interesting mechanism, but I wonder if it’s sustainable in the long term.
* **Correlation with Gold and USD**: The initial liquidity is split between USDC and PAXG, providing stability during volatile market conditions.
* **Focus on Decentralization**: Governance is entirely DAO-driven, and they’ve capped creator holdings at only 2% of the initial supply.
* **Whale Protection**: Their transfer limits and temporary hodl restrictions during the ICO are designed to prevent market manipulation.

They’ve also laid out a detailed roadmap, with plans to launch their first DeFi application and gaming ecosystem by 2025. While I admire their vision, I’m curious about the community’s thoughts on whether such mechanisms can truly deliver on their promise of stability and growth.

A few questions for discussion:

1. What do you think about the 10% daily transfer limit? Does it actually prevent manipulation, or could it restrict healthy market dynamics?
2. How sustainable is their correlation with gold and USD in a market largely driven by speculative trading?
3. The DAO governance model sounds great in theory, but in practice, how effective is it for a project like this?

I’m genuinely intrigued but also skeptical (as always with new projects in this space). Looking forward to hearing your insights!

GodfatherOfficial,"Kendu Inu, just another slow rug","When it comes to meme coins, some work while others don’t. Community is important, but what if that community consists of a limited number of insiders promoting it as genuine? This post aims to highlight that many meme coins are merely pump-and-dump schemes, often masked by smoke and mirrors, leaving investors hoping the developers are truly working and not just gambling for quick cash.

Take Kendu Inu, for example, which is on Ethereum and soon to be on Solana. Their motto is, “We don’t gamble, we work.” But the reality is different. The developer, Miazaki, is known for creating meme coins, pumping them up, and then dumping them. The Telegram community is filled with random posts that have no real influence on the coin, and the Twitter/X page features Miazaki with his middle fingers up—definitely not a professional image.

Many people are frustrated that he’s been working on other coins, leading to more departures from the Kendu community. Most long-term holders since May believe January 2025 will be crucial for the coin's future. However, Miazaki's indifferent attitude has turned many off; a man is only as good as his word.

The Solana bridge is seen as an attempt to adapt to market conditions, but it raises more questions than answers. The developer even promised that Kendu Inu would reach a $1 billion market cap by the end of the year, jokingly stating he would staple his forehead with paper if it didn’t happen. With only six days left, there’s no sign of that staple or any real progress.

I guarantee that 2025 will continue a downward trend in price action for this coin. This is a warning for newcomers: do not invest your hard-earned money. I’ve worked hard for mine, and it feels wasted. The “team” is busy creating more cash grabs, and Miazaki has made false promises about sticking to Ethereum, only to change course based on community feedback.

I’m willing to bet that this coin won’t reach its all-time high by the end of March 2025.

Donsaudi29,What is your plan on Ton Station $SOON? ,"I know many people are still angry about $Soon listing price especially with that low FDV of $7.5 million. This possibly force most airdroppers to hold rather than dump which could be another good sign for the project. Despite potential of Ton Station, this listing price caused a lot of negative opinions on the project but I think long-term holders won’t be affect with the initial listing price.  My allocation was also very low but I had to just hold and look for other options to increase my holding while awaiting that positive price trend by staking some $btc in Bitget Poolx to earn from a pool of 140,000,000 $SOON. Since this is a passive income since this reward doesnot affect my staked btc so I feel this will be a better decision.

ANARCHY is a fun and psychotic cult. That’s a good thing. 

Dev has taken projects like Kendu over 300million before this bullrun even started. Same thing will happen here. This ain’t our first rodeo. 

ANARCHY means destroying institutions that oppressed you.

Well, the thing that oppressed you most of your life is yourself. Time to stop fucking around and be reborn.

We don’t coddle, we encourage--- You can work harder on your crypto projects and on yourself. And that is great fucking news. Because making more effort in every aspect of your life feels god damn great.

Our motto is WE ARE NOT FUCKING AROUND.

In ANARCHY we use ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME in our telegram. It’s contagious because it changes your attitude and supercharges your belief in your community and yourself. 

There is a reason you see ANARCHY all over reddit.

Because the community is a rabid cult of fanatics. We don’t buy ‘sol trending’ because that brings in people chasing a pump who sell when the ad expires. “Marketing Budgets” are for people who have no fucking idea how to build a culture and think they can buy one. We don’t have to spend a single penny on marketing, because we are so dedicated and driven, any time you see a reddit post about us, it has more organic comments than any other project on whatever post you’re reading this on. Our ‘marketing budget’ never runs out because it is purely us. If you are reading this you know it is working. And growing. 

Memes are built on hype. Those of you who have made money last bullrun (or this one) know that this business isn't luck or magic, it's a numbers game. You have thousands of people shouting your name every day and a couple hundred new holders join.

Join the TG before you buy this or any token, see how the most hyped community in all of crypto lives.

Tokenomics are rock solid. Dev burnt 55% of supply. No wallets over 3%. Literally largest burn in defi history.

Past_Hotel_5987,Hyperliquid: Potential to Reach $200? Let's Talk About It.,"Hey crypto friends! Today, we're diving deep into the HYPE token from Hyperliquid. We're all wondering: does this gem have the potential to climb to $200 by the end of the bull cycle? Well, let's try to unpack that together. Buckle up, it's going to be a ride!  
The Fundamentals:  
Let's start with the basics - the fundamentals. Hyperliquid isn't just another DEX (Decentralized Exchange) in the DeFi jungle; it's an ecosystem on a Layer 1 blockchain aiming to shake up the game. First thing to note: no VC (Venture Capital). You heard that right. Hyperliquid has been 100% community-funded, which is pretty cool because it means the team is truly motivated to make the project thrive for its users, not some investors.  
The Team:  
The Hyperliquid team is impressive. We're talking former employees from Jane Street, Andreessen Horowitz, and even MIT. The founder, Notsofast, is an ex-crypto trader with a clear vision for decentralized trading. This team has the chops to make Hyperliquid a world-class platform.   
The Technology:  
Technologically, Hyperliquid is a dream. They've developed their own blockchain with a consensus algorithm called HyperBFT - super fast, with block latency under 1 second and a capacity to handle 150,000 transactions per second. No gas fees, low trading fees, and a user interface that doesn't hurt your eyes. All this translates to a smooth and efficient trading environment. And with HyperEVM coming, integration with Ethereum could open up a bunch of new possibilities.  
Community Sentiment:  
The sentiment around HYPE within the community is electric. Since the massive airdrop, people are excited, active, and there's real belief in this project's potential. Forums, Twitter, Discord - everywhere you see lively discussions, strategy sharing, and genuine passion for what Hyperliquid is building.   
Statistics and Metrics:  


* CMC (CoinMarketCap): HYPE has already shown it can grab attention with impressive trading volumes and rapid market cap growth post-TGE.
* FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation): Looking at the total supply of 1 billion tokens, projecting a price of $200 gives us an FDV of $200 billion. That's huge, but in a bull market with massive adoption and novel uses, anything's possible, right?
* Total Supply vs. Circulating Supply: There's a total of 1 billion tokens, but only about 333 million in circulation after the airdrop (with plans to increase this supply), so relative scarcity could work in favor of price increase.

Now, reaching $200 seems ambitious, but the stars are aligning quite favorably for HYPE:  


* Continued platform adoption with more traders and dapps coming on board.
* Technological updates that could make Hyperliquid a major player.
* A passionate community actively promoting and using the token.
* And most importantly, the absence of VC funding, which might mean less pressure for quick exits and more focus on sustainable growth.

Of course, this is crypto, and it can be an emotional roller coaster. But if Hyperliquid keeps up its momentum, who knows? Maybe HYPE at $200 isn't that crazy. Stay tuned, stay engaged, and above all, do your own research. If you're a trader, Bitget still has 1700 HYPE in their Candyboom event, which might interest someone.  
Catch you later for more adventures in the world of crypto!  
Don't forget to mention the strong points I forgot to analyze.

Kaayaa_ag4a,Woman chops off her boyfriend's genitals with a knife as his marriage was with another woman,"In a shockingly disturbing incident, a woman took this drastic action against her man.

The couple was reportedly in a relationship for 8 years, and when the woman came to know that the man was going to marry another woman, she arranged to meet him and cut off his penis with a sharp-edged weapon. She then slashed her own wrist.

The injured man was taken to a hospital where he is in a serious condition now. The woman has been detained for interrogation.

Under a post on the platform X (formerly Twitter) by a journalist on this incident of 'Bobbitization', ""she will be out of prison as in just few days as all laws will help her,"" commented a user. ""His own life is hell and his lover's too, When someone cheats on you after a long-term relationship, it's natural to feel furious. However, wise individuals calm themselves down and move forward,"" wrote another user. ""they would write tons of paragraphs if the genders were reversed,"", ""Madam be like, ""If I can't have it, no one can,"""", ""Why are criminals allowed to hide their faces? if anything posters should be put up a warning to stay away from these people,"" were some more comments.

Well, we’re at the point where daily having arguments never engagement and intimacy and things are just stressful and not very pleasant. I’ve tried to get a partner and a child to stop scrolling on phones in free time, to make a healthier mindset. I’ve asked both of them to come with me to walk and exercise to get stronger, but to no avail they won’t come with me. And any other areas where we can find moments and times to improve life build skills or just be better, it’s never received, and I’m always denied or rejected for those ideas. I’m just convinced, I need to start over. I need moment of time to refocus on myself make myself a better man. I want to push my education further and create a new life where I have a chance to connect with a partner one day that will understand me better, value, mental, emotional, and physical health more, and someone that wants to be intimate with me on the regular basis.

If they feel rhey were picked and made special by a very respectable, liked, wealthy man to make her a respectable, liked, wealthy queen. They ALL, honestly, when it's face to face in the dating game, do not care if you murder children as a job, as long as you have the millions to show for it. My cousins sold drugs to children and made a fortune very young and now is very respected. Ya. My advice I'm giving to you here is that you are a slave to the system and you can't do anything about it, should you want a family or wife. That wife, 95% chance  DOES NOT want you. They only want your money or your body if you hit jackpot ideal genes. Every relationship from high school grad I know ended up this way, and the men I grew up with are very ignorant in how much their women actually hate them. Women think 9ther women are beautiful. They think you are ugly... only unless you own millions of dollars.

  
Everyone below that very wealthy status is a slave to the system, especially men.

Family_Law_Activist,Merry Christmas to all You Believers in Paper Abortion ,"Merry Christmas to all the Fathers that have been Forced to be Fathers out there. Being a Forced Parent is psychological damaging, then you are Forced into a A Child Support System that only sees you as a Bank Account. 

A lot of forced fathers are subjected to Negative opinions about their Beliefs on how they were forced into being a parent for a unwanted child during the holidays, as they are around family and friends from a community they once lived in and took part in. 

This can be damaging to the Man as it may bring up Emotional Trauma during holiday dinners when a Family Member ask about the Woman that has forced them into Hell and brings up the unwanted child during Holiday Meals.

Me personally, Child support to me has felt like Prison but living freely in a community. 

9 years left in Prison for Me. I’ve been in survival mode since I started paying child support. I pray for relief and most the time I pray to God to take me off this planet or take me out of the corrupt Family law system. 

I didn’t understand what poverty was like until I was forced into paying child support for a child I never wanted. I feel the child’s mother had no right bringing a child that I never wanted into this world. 

At 40 I feel like I missed my opportunity to have a Family with a Woman that I wanted Marriage and a family with.

Enjoy your Holidays with Family and Friends. when the conversation of Abortion comes up, don’t be afraid to bring up how you think it’s time Men should be allowed Equal Rights to ROEvWADE and be allowed a Paper Abortion.

I don’t wish what I’ve gone through to any young man coming of age in this world, young men will make mistakes, they deserve freedom and choice after those mistakes but we need to bring the discussion of Paper Abortion to the ones around us so people can understand something that’s important us.

opposite233,Paternity test is forbidden in France while LEGAL in all the other lands. There is a reason to this. ,"I will explain.

What is a paternity test: 
A man now may know if a child is his son (=from his lineage) or another by doing dna test with 2 samples: 1 fragment from him and 1 of the (presumed) son, which go to laboratory.
It is called a paternity test.

Just a bit of context.
""Historically, men could not always tell a son was theirs.""
This assumption is FALSE.
They often could tell he was not:  
Because they knew if they saw the woman  at the time of the conception.
Because they knew when some phenotypics charasteristics COULD NOT be theirs.
Same is for aborption. 
Assumption that women always may abort is FALSE. Women most of time just didnt have the knowledge to.

Here is the real reason to interdiction of paternity test in France:
MOST OF FRENCH WOMEN ARE UNFAITHFUL  (Yes,  look at the statistics). HENCE the opposition to this test (while it is authorized in all other countries) on the grounds of: 
-the integrity of the body (while medically assisted procreation is authorized...)
- That blood ties are not this important (while biology says the opposite with microchimeras)
- That a man can very well raise another's child (while a man marries to have a child from him precisely)

I mean I've seen male refs take a lot more than that without calling two techs. Now, to be fair to the ref, I think a male ref might have called ONE technical, but two??? Below is a link you can got to if you want to see the incident. You have to scroll down a little to see the video. It's the second video down, by the way, not the first video. You ave to go down to the second video, which is in a tweet by CJ Fogler. EDIT: By sexism, I mean was he ejected at least partly because he yelled at a woman.

Agasda3Z,"Universal Basic Income (UBI): Is it a step towards a more compassionate society, or the beginning of economic collapse?""","Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been a hot topic for years now, but the debate over its effectiveness and impact on society has only intensified. Some see it as a revolutionary solution to poverty, inequality, and job displacement due to automation. Others argue that it’s a dangerous idea that could lead to economic collapse and discourage hard work.

Here’s where I stand:

* **Supporters of UBI** argue that it would provide a safety net for all citizens, ensuring basic living standards regardless of job status. This would allow people to pursue passions, education, and creative work without the constant fear of financial instability. Plus, with automation taking away traditional jobs, UBI could be a necessary step to prevent mass unemployment.
* **Critics** believe that UBI would be a massive drain on the economy. Funding it would require huge tax hikes or redistribution of wealth, which could discourage productivity and innovation. What happens when people receive money without working for it? Could we see widespread dependency on the government? And, would businesses stop paying fair wages, knowing that everyone has a basic income?

UBI proponents point to countries like Finland and Canada, where small-scale pilot programs showed promising results. However, critics argue that those pilots were limited and didn’t account for the long-term consequences.

In my opinion, we need to seriously evaluate how we want our society to function moving forward. Do we value an individual’s right to financial stability and freedom, even if it means higher taxes or a shift in the job market? Or do we stick to a more traditional system where hard work, employment, and self-sufficiency are valued above all else?

I want to hear what the Reddit community thinks:

* Should we experiment with UBI as a long-term solution?
* Or would it be disastrous for the economy and our sense of personal responsibility?

Throwaway921845,"Left-wing Democrats argue the party lost because it's too moderate. Moderate Democrats argue the party lost because it's too ""woke"". Who is right?","On one hand, left-wing Democrats argue that the party lost because it failed to motivate the activist wing of the party, especially young people, by embracing anti-Trump Republicans like Liz Cheney and catering to corporate interests. This threading of the middle line, they claim, is the wrong way to go, and reconfiguring the party's messaging around left-wing values like universal health care, high taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, and doubling down on diversity, equality and inclusivity, also known as DEI, is key to returning to power.

On the other hand, moderate Democrats argue, Trump's return to office proves that the American people will not stand for a Democratic party that has deserted the working class to focus on niche issues no one cares about like taxpayer funded gender-affirming care for incarcerated trans people. Moderate Democrats believe that the party should continue on the path walked by Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The most potent argument for moderate Democrats is that Joe Biden, the quintessential moderate, roundly defeated Donald Trump in 2020 by 7 million votes.

Left-wing Democrats' answer is that, yes, Biden may have won in 2020, but his administration's failure to secure another victory proves that the time has come to ditch moderate policies and to move to the left. If a far-right candidate like Trump can win the voters' hearts, why couldn't a far-left candidate, they say?

Moderate Democrats' answer is that the 2024 election was Harris' failure, not Biden's, and Harris' move to Biden's left was a strategic mistake.

Left-wing Democrats' answer is that voters repudiated the Biden administration as a whole, not solely Harris.

That being said, the consensus was that she wasn’t very successful at fully separating herself from Biden and his administration.

Awesomeuser90,How well do you think state legislatures react to court rulings with new legislation and constitutional amendments?,"In the federal judiciary, the Congress can clearly pass new legislation if the courts make rulings they don't like on most topics. The issue with Chevron deference could have been solved decades ago by writing that concept in to law. If an executive rule is not upheld by a court for conflict with statute or otherwise not being a power of the executive, well, the legislature could probably enact it themselves or at least vote on whether it should be adopted or not. The issue with a lone judge in the fifth circuit getting a bunch of cases that have no good reason to actually be given to him via forum shopping and daring the appeals courts and supreme court to override him at some point later would be an easy thing to resolve by legislation.

But with Congress having so little energy to move its wheels of operation that it feels like trying to change Jupiter's motion around the Sun, little actually comes out of these processes with finality or public input.

State governments however do have their own independent rules and systems, and they too can respond to state judicial rulings. They can usually react to the ruling by statutory changes or sometimes changes to executive and administrative rules, and the state governments are far more likely to propose constitutional changes for the people to vote on as well if there is a showdown. How effective do you think this is in practice overall, in states you admire, and in your own state or territory?",2024-12-23 19:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hkvosf/how_well_do_you_think_state_legislatures_react_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,False

East_Inevitable_5128,Is Musk’s social media power setting the stage to undermine Trump’s need for control?,"Note: These are my own ideas, arguments, and knowledge, articulated more clearly with GenAI assistance.

Elon Musk and Donald Trump are two of the most dominant and influential figures of our time, each driven by a profound need for control and the ability to shape public perception. Trump thrives on commanding attention and being the center of every narrative, while Musk wields power not only through innovation and business but now through his ownership of X (formerly Twitter). At first glance, they might seem like natural allies, disruptors with massive followings. But their overlapping ambitions and psychological need for dominance could create significant tension, especially on social media.

Currently, Trump and Musk appear to be aligned in their goals. They’ve both positioned themselves as anti-establishment figures, critical of traditional media and government overreach, and champions of free speech and innovation. However, this alignment is unlikely to last in the long term. Their fundamentally different views on the world and priorities will almost certainly create a divide. Trump’s focus is rooted in nationalistic, populist politics and loyalty-based power structures, while Musk’s priorities are global and future-oriented, focusing on technology, space exploration, and renewable energy. These contrasting visions of leadership and influence make a lasting partnership improbable.

Musk’s control over X has already shown its potential to influence public discourse, as seen in controversies like the recent government shutdown narratives amplified through his platform. For Trump, who once dominated Twitter with his unfiltered, headline-grabbing posts, Musk’s ability to control the algorithms and shape the visibility of content could feel like a direct challenge to his authority. The risk here is clear: if Musk’s platform dictates the framing of Trump’s messages or if Musk subtly overshadows him, it could create the impression that Trump is no longer the master of his narrative but instead a figure operating within Musk’s domain.

This dynamic plays into their psychological traits. Trump’s identity relies on being seen as the ultimate decision-maker, someone who cannot be controlled. Meanwhile, Musk, with his penchant for trolling and dominance, may find it difficult to resist subtly steering the narrative in ways that highlight his own power. Over time, this could lead to a perception that Trump is Musk’s puppet, a devastating blow to Trump’s carefully cultivated image as a strong, independent leader.

For Musk, aligning too closely with Trump also carries risks. Musk’s fanbase is diverse, and being seen as too tied to Trump could alienate parts of his following who view Musk as forward-thinking and apolitical. The relationship between these two figures feels like a high-stakes psychological chess match, with both seeking to dominate their shared audience. The question is, how long can Trump tolerate being in Musk’s shadow before their uneasy alliance fractures? And if a clash comes, who will emerge with their influence intact?

What are your thoughts? Are we seeing the beginning of a rivalry between two of the world’s most dominant personalities? Or could they co-exist in a symbiotic, if uneasy, relationship?",2024-12-22 11:14:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hjwkex/is_musks_social_media_power_setting_the_stage_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,False

Diligent_Platypus685,[US-OH] Can I escrow my rent for high-pitch noise? What other options should I follow?,"\[US-OH\]

Video link: [https://imgur.com/a/WH51ft5](https://imgur.com/a/WH51ft5)

I have been hearing this high-pitched hum in my apartment since late November that has been driving me crazy. It is louder next to my bedroom and bathroom wall. It is intermittent, with varying intensity (usually louder at night), but once it starts, it will last for 30 minutes or so, with shorter 10-15 minute breaks (I haven’t recorded exact times). This means that I can hear it for the majority of the day and night. When I am in the bedroom, I can hear it with my earbuds on and noise cancelling. It WOULD prevent me from sleeping until I moved my mattress to my living room floor and started wearing earplugs at night, and even then I can still hear it. This issue has rendered my bedroom intolerable for the day and night, and I need to have noise-cancelling earbuds or earplugs in the house for any time longer than 15 minutes. I do not have a sound level meter yet to measure exactly how loud it is.

I put up 2 maintenance requests in early December, each a week apart, and they got nowhere besides me being given speculation about what the issue could be (neighbor’s fan appliances, electrical issues, vents, etc.). After sending out an email, my leasing office brought two heating companies to see what the issue was. The leasing office claimed that the first company said it was normal noise, and that there is no fix for it until after winter, and that it may relate to heat pumps. They claimed the second company thought it was my fridge, which was on the opposite side of the noise source. It was making a noise of its own but not the noise I was concerned about. They replaced the fridge but the problem persisted. Now it has been over 3 weeks since I first mentioned it and my leasing office has altered between saying they have no short-term fix for this, and most recently that they will work on the issue. To me, it seems at this point that this will go nowhere so I want to explore other options.

One of them I have read is escrowing rent. Would this issue meet the bar for sending a notice that I will escrow my rent after 30 days? Would I need to get an inspector’s report first to see if it violates building codes before I follow that approach? Some sources I have read suggest that the inspection can be requested after the rent escrow letter is sent. Moreover, at what point would it be better to just consult different lawyers? I could break my lease for $4k, or have someone buy it out, which means I have to pay rent+utilities until someone else gets the place, but I have gotten conflicting information from leasing agents about the lease buyout that I will need to clarify first.",2024-12-24 20:07:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1hllff8/usoh_can_i_escrow_my_rent_for_highpitch_noise/,Ohio,False

pineapple_bandit,Mirena removal experience reminds me that women's healthcare in the US is awful,"My Mirena IUD was removed a few weeks ago after having IUDs for 12 years. I'm in my early 50s and hormone tests show I'm menopausal and the current IUD was at the end of its life so it made sense. I spoke with my female MD obgyn at my annual this summer and made an appointment for removal in November. 

That appointment didn't go well. I've had a Mirena removed in the past for replacement and it was no problem but this time my gyn couldn't find it. After some painful fishing around she concluded that I'd have to come back so she could use an ultrasound to find the IUD.

I come back Dec. 3 and she removes it with the ultrasound pretty quickly. She tells me I might bleed or cramp for a few days but otherwise I'll see her next year for my annual.

Since then I've had migraines nearly every day. I get migraines regularly but not nearly this frequently,  I capped out on my rescue meds for the month a week ago.

More oddly, I've had really bad mood swings when ive never had them before, ,  a ton of anxiety including this ""pit in my stomach"" feeling for no apparent reason, and I've been nauseous a lot. 

I'm on a 4 day vacation that I booked specifically to get away and relax but woke up with a migraine AGAIN for the 4th consecutive day, so looks Iike I'll be skipping the yoga class I booked.
I can't really take more meds because I'm getting to the point where I'll get rebound migraines from too much meds.

I googled it this morning and it turns out that Mirena Crash is a known common thing many women experience when they remove their IUD. It's from the absence of progestin and can be treated or even prevented.

WHY WHY WHY in 3 appointments with my  obgyn did she never once mention this? Why didn't she warn me or suggest preventive measures? I thought I've been going crazy the past few weeks but actually it could have been avoided or treated weeks ago if I even knew it was something to look for.

Also, my insurance company denied the claim for the ultrasound charge because healthcare in the US sucks.",2024-12-25 14:26:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hm1mxd/mirena_removal_experience_reminds_me_that_womens/,TwoXChromosomes,False
Sasenney,Is it over between me and him?,"Me (29F) and My bf (31M) are going through rough time. Is it over?

Me (29f) and my boyfriend (31m) are together for 13 years. Our anniversary is on 27th of December, so pretty close. However, I’m not sure if we will make it during Christmas. It will be a long post, because we were tohether for sooo long…

Something about us. I have a full family: mom, dad and brother. We are from the middle class. But because of my dad’s actions, I am constantly anxious, have anxious attachment style and have zero self esteem. I was never good enough, everything I did was bad, or only “ok”. I have a supportive mother, but dad was and still is not ideal. My boyfriend on the other hand is an only child with only a mother. She is no longer with us, she died at pretty young age of 42 because of the sickness that also my boyfriend has. His father was an addict and alcoholic, also he had problem with aggression. Mother was always at work, my boyfriend was constantly alone and rise himself mostly. He is an avoidant, has adhd and also problem with talking, opening up, drinking and taking drugs.

Now our story: we met 13 years ago the day after Christmas. We previously chatted via game, because we were nerds and we were spending time in the game and it was, especially for me, the only way to have friends and be liked no matter my looks. We clicked pretty on the spot. We started dating and hanging out from the day one. He was at my place for the New Year. He said that he loved me during our first Easter together. We were happy. Of course we had our fights because of our differences, my anxiousness and his avoidance, but it was good, really good. However, when the first year passes, my anxiety started to get worse and I’ve cried almost everyday without a reason. My thoughts were awful and I couldn’t control them. At the beginning he was helping me, but later he had enough. That was our first breakup, and it was my fault. But we’ve talked about it and seems to make it work. Everything was ok. But the biggest problem between us was 3 years ago. He started drinking heavily, doing drugs and having one night stands. Somewhere in between his bad months his mom died, so the spiral went deeper and deeper. Finally I found out about this stands and all the cheating and wanted to break up. But, maybe I was so in love, he promised to change because of his love. He stops drinking and taking drugs. But everything was, and still is, in my head. I couldn’t control my feelings and thoughts about all of it. But after figuring it out, we were again so happy… We started going out more, experiment in the bedroom, spending awesome time together. I was sure that we have everything under control.

But my mind couldn’t let go. I was anxious, not happy and still thinking that he is cheating, telling lies or something like that. So we fight more, at least once per week. He stoped to tell me that he loves me, he stoped hugging me or having fun with me. When he is home he mostly sleeps or watch tik tok. I was sure something was wrong. My mind couldn’t stop thinking about bad possibilities. So I’ve checked his phone, it was a couple of days ago. There were conversations with a girl from his work. Everything I wish he did with me, he did with her. He was asking her about her day, did she ate, he is sending her funny videos, and from the conversation I also knew that he was playing with her like in a friendly way. So I ask him about that. He told me that she is only a friend, that he loves me and wants to be with me, but he also noticed that his feelings towards me changed and he don’t know why. So I asked him if he wants to be with her. He said that he loves me and wants to be with me, but he likes her and if we wouldn’t be together he might see. I asked him if he will do it right away after our breakup, but he just get angry and said that “of course, because those 13 years means nothing”. He also said that he has no big emotions for like couple of years now and he thinks he can’t be happy anymore and he doesn’t know why.

But yesterday in was Christmas Eve. We were going to my brother house and it was important that we leave early. But he had to stay. I was sure something was fishy. I’ve checked his phone one more time and O was right. He stayed with her, but also someone needed to stay until 4 P.M. He volunteered. And I know from this conversation that he was keeping her company. I am anxious so I asked him about it. He was so mad that I am spying on him. He is right, I shouldn’t do that, but because of his cheating and not being honest, it was awful to not think about other possibilities. He said that he right now is not sure what he feels, he is not acknowledging my existence and is not present for me, but for other people yes. He said that we can try to work things out, he hugged me during sleep, pretty tight, but is still distant in the morning. Is there anything I can do or is it long gone and I am waisting my time?
Lastly I want to add that he is not good at doing house chores, he is lazy and not romantic. And I am not from USA, so sorry for my English. 

TLDR:I checked my partner’s phone because of his infidelity and I’m not sure if there is something I can do more, or should we break up.",2024-12-25 11:54:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hlzfbb/is_it_over_between_me_and_him/,TwoXChromosomes,False
Allthefoodintheworld,"An antidote to the ""my husband did nothing for Christmas"" posts and a reminder not to settle for anything other than a true partner. ","I woke up from my post-Christmas lunch nap to my two cats begging for their dinner. I was a bit annoyed because I knew my husband was downstairs and I wondered why they didn't ask him or why he hadn't already fed them. I got downstairs and was greeted by the sight of my husband in the backyard, in gloves, kneepads and mask, literally on his hands and knees poop-scooping our garden beds. Our cats refuse to use the litter tray to poop and they have free access to our enclosed backyard, so we have to frequently poop-scoop the garden beds. It's been quite a few weeks since it's been done as it's both of our least favourite jobs and we've been putting it off. Now this wonderful man is doing it without me having to ask.

Oh, and the kitchen is spotless. He cleaned up the mess made by our rushed Christmas salad making this morning. 

I know we should't feel the need to reward or applaud taking basic responsibility for shared household tasks, but so many of the posts on this sub lately have been about men not pulling their weight.

Pristine-Grade-768,“I don’t watch/read the news”,This above statement terrifies me. Evil people are reeking havoc on the planet and we are often coached to not do the above. It’s terrifying for a plethora of reasons. What people do when they think they are not being watched or reported on is so much worse than what we found out about them. How can one feel safe when one is ignorant to what is actually going on barring social media propaganda?,2024-12-25 08:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hlwyon/i_dont_watchread_the_news/,TwoXChromosomes,False
Flat-Syllabub-9271,Sex for the first time after being celibate for almost 2 years.,"I had no idea where to post this so hopefully this is the right place, because I desperately need to get this off my chest and unfortunately don’t have anyone in my life to talk to personally. So, as the title says I had sex the other night for the first time in almost 2 years. I had done celibate mainly by choice. At first it was just because I had stopped actively seeking out any form of relationship with another human, but then I realized it was probably a good idea for me to take a break. Before I had a “hoe phase” and I wouldn’t wait long at all to sleep with someone and didn’t really care for most of the people I slept with. I felt this had become unhealthy specifically for me because I thought maybe I was using sex as a form of validation and just a way to feel good because I wasn’t feeling good any other way in my day to day life. Anyways.. that’s why I stopped. Eventually I thought okay I could get back out there but I stayed celibate because 1. I wanted to if possible finally have sex again with someone I had built more of a connection with, I didn’t want to give just anyone access to that part of me 2. I couldn’t find anyone who I was attracted to and wanted to do it with me and/or wanted to have that deeper (not physical) connection with me first. So I stayed celibate and I was proud of it. Horny and lonely but proud. I had gotten on the dating apps but it never went anywhere so I never spent much time on it before deleting it again. But I recently moved and was bored and particularly lonely so I downloaded hinge. I finally found someone who I was having great conversation with and was attracted to. He also asked to take me out pretty quickly which I liked because I had dragged out convos with others just waiting to meet up and they never would. So I agreed to go out with him. But I was leaving on a trip out of town the next day and the movie he wanted to take us too was sold out. So I just told him come over to watch a movie, we can talk more that way too. I should’ve known where it would lead but I gave the situation the benefit of the doubt. So he comes over, he’s cute in person, we’re having great conversations still and watching the movie. It’s going well. After the movie ends, I put on another and then he makes a move to start kissing me. I accept and we start kissing. He quickly escalates it. This puts me in a bit of a panic. Like I previously said I’ve been lonely and very horny. So part of me is screaming that I do want to also escalate this but then I’m also screaming at myself to stop, don’t take it further, don’t give it away that quick after all this time. I don’t know how to fight this internal battle quickly. In hindsight I should have stopped to think about it but I don’t know how to say no and stop a situation either (I know that is horrible). So I just let it go on. He pulls up my shirt is sucking on boobs. He starts kissing me again but it felt like he was overly excited so he’s pushing against me so much that it started to become not very enjoyable at all. Like I love kissing and it aggravates me when someone doesn’t do it well, like make it slow and sensual so we can build up the tension. So I push him back and get on top of him to try and take control of this situation and make it more enjoyable for myself. I start kissing and licking him, his neck and ears, down. And it’s nice but then he starts saying oh my god oh my god. Over and over. Like I get saying that once or twice but he said it so many times. And not like under his breath, ya know like it an exasperated way, but he was saying it like normal level normal tone. So it felt weird to me. But we kept on going. He pushes me back and say I want to fuck you so bad. I’m again panicking at this point. Cause I’m like I don’t want to have sex we just met, I’ve been celibate I don’t want to break it now. But I also don’t feel like I know how to say no. So I take control by giving him head. In my head that’s me giving him what he wants but not sex but once again in hindsight I’m like of course that would just make him want it more. So as I’m giving him the head he agains says oh my god way too many times, but at least he adds some other stuff in there that was pleasant to hear like good girl, but it all felt a little stiff and threw me off but I kept on. He finishes and immediately pushes me back and starts to take off my pants. I stop him and say no not that not yet but he starts to again try and take them off. I say no I’m shy, but he quickly pulls them off just my butt so my legs are pushed back and my butt is exposed and he quickly puts his finger in me. Well it is what it is at that point is kinda how I felt and I was horny and half of me wanted it anyway. So I let him finger me. It feels great and I’m into it. He then goes to take my pants all the way off. I try to stop him again but he says something like don’t you want me in you (I can’t remember exactly how he said it but something like that). In my mind I’ve given in to the fact I do want him to fuck me but I haven’t shaved my legs or anything in a long time (since I’ve been celibate anyways) so I’m very shy and embarrassed as to what he’ll think. But he’s seen part of it anyways and is already pulling them off so oh well I guess we’ll see what he does. Well he’s pulled them off and I don’t know if he just doesn’t care or if he’s so horny that he’s like oh well might as well go for it now. But he ignores that fact I’m embarrassingly hairy and he goes inside me. We start having sex and at first it’s good. It’s hard for me to get out of my head about feeling insecure about being hairy though and he didn’t really do any foreplay so I’m not as wet as I usually would be, and he’s pounding me. Like I appreciate it being rough but he’s just pounding away, again I feel like he’s overly excited. I tried to push back a little so I could get myself wet or something but he kinda prevents me from doing so, so we keep on like this. So the whole time it’s halfway enjoyable for me. I forgot to mention right before he put it in he paused asked if I was on birth control then pulled out a condom he then put on. But as he’s getting close to finishing he pulls out and takes the condom off and goes back inside me. I’m thinking in my head like wait what why fuck oh well. Then as hes fucking me he says he wants to come inside me so bad. This turns me on but also scares me cause I’m like please don’t (lol). So I tell him to come in my mouth. He then pulls out and comes on my face/in my mouth. It was pretty quick sex. We clean off and then sit for a bit and talk again. It wasn’t really awkward after we still had a good conversation and then he hugged me and asked me to tell him when I’m back in town so he could take me out for a real date. I go to the bathroom and I’m bleeding. I don’t know why, I never bleed after sex. So I think perhaps it’s from how rough he was and that I wasn’t wet enough. Then the next day I hurt down there I’m so sore and I think again it’s because how rough he was. And like I said I like it rough some times but that wasn’t even nice rough it was just pounding ya know. So I’m left feeling pretty disappointed with the first sex I’ve had in two years. And now I’m mad at myself because after staying strong all this time I gave it up that easily just for it to be disappointing. And I liked the guy too, so now what if he thinks I’m easy and stops talking to me. But he doesn’t realize I just let him fuck me after being celibate for two years so am I really that easy and/or shouldn’t he feel lucky. I just don’t know how to feel about any of this. My feelings are so conflicted and I low key high key feel like shit. I wish it wouldn’t have happened. I’m mad at myself. And I’m still bleeding a little which I’m like wth should I be concerned. I do want to have sex but I just want it to be really good or just wait for someone I actually have a connection with. But that kind of feels impossible a bit.

bwowie,How to handle gift giving disappointment from male partner!?!,"With Christmas this year and my birthday very close to Christmas, me and my partner are spending it apart (we’re long distance anyway). 

When it was his birthday I was there and got him some very nice and niche gifts for his interests, spent a good couple of months searching and whatever. He absolutely loved it and still raves about the gifts. For Christmas I sent him a card and letter in the mail - I don’t mind getting anything because I just love gift giving and being thoughtful. He didn’t get me anything and that expected I didnt want anything.

However, for my birthday he’s already implied i’ve got nothing. I joked and said snail mailing me a birthday card is cheap! and he got upset and started saying he felt guilty because he didn’t get me anything because he’s broke, been busy ect. 

Whatever, honestly. My only thing is I don’t celebrate Christmas with any family and don’t receive anything else on my birthday (i’m used to both so it’s fine) I’m just getting really sick of being disappointed with not having this sort of thing reciprocated. I love crafts and gift giving, any small thing even handmade would mean a lot and he doesn’t even think about it. 

I seriously don’t get it. He knows me more than anyone in the world and can’t even write a letter? I’m not sure how to go about it or how to stop expecting things. He’s such a sweetheart but I seriously just don’t understand and don’t know what to do or how to not be upset. 

some extra context update: we both recently lost our jobs (same workplace lol) and got similar payouts, and have had to move cities. he says he’s very stressed and has been busy so hasn’t had time to think about it. Am I being extra? ",2024-12-25 07:47:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hlwd2o/how_to_handle_gift_giving_disappointment_from/,TwoXChromosomes,False
ImportantShoe,Is emotional intelligence really too much to ask for?,"In a convo w my mom I criticized how many men lack empathy for others, are unable to emotionally regulate, and feel uncomfortable when faced with unpleasant emotions. She said that men are just like that, it could just be biological, and that I'd never be able to find a partner with those traits. I replied that just because she wasn't able to, doesn't mean that I never will. Was that too harsh? Is that really expecting too much?

I guess I just consider myself an optimist in the sense that if I never expect those things from men, then society will never change. I am so opposed to just resigning to the fact that men are ""just like that."" The thought of living in a world where we expect nothing from men is just too depressing for me to accept.

wanderlustbimbo,Can we talk about frustrating it is when men wait until the last minute for holiday shopping?,"This is something that affects the other women in my family more than it affects me (since I am not in a relationship). 

My family already has a lot of problems; I could probably write a 20-page essay detailing these issues, but I digress.

However, something I've noticed about the men specifically is that they procrastinate beyond belief when it comes to doing something for their wife/girlfriend for any holiday event. Be it Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and Anniversary, Christmas, etc.

Then the women often get stuck with something that isn't meaningful or that they can't even use. My cousin actually got lingerie this year - she hates lingerie; and the gift was clearly for her husband, not her.

I don't know if this is something that is super common, and it is rather confusing to me. Why do they wait so long?

k2p1e,Christmas Dilemma,"Every major holiday I call and invite my parents who live not too far from us for dinner. For the past 20 years we have spent almost every major holiday together.
I come from a large family and none of my siblings invite them or want them there. My kids have grown up to expect them at our home. 
Here is the thing, I always message my mother about the invite. All of our communication over the past two years has been me inviting here. She has not once instigated a conversation.
When I was in my early 20’s I talked to her on the phone daily, about 10 years ago she said she needed more separation from her grandchildren… she had picked them up once from school and never babysat but we would visit weekly. 5 years ago she cancelled her home phone and got a cell phone and told me she would text me her number when she was ready. She never did. I haven’t spoken to her in the phone since. When my kids ask her to come to their events she tells them she will and then complains to me she has raised her children and don’t ask her again. Typically boomer online about her dear grandchildren but my kids are teens and have caught on. 
She calls my siblings regularly and visits them each once a month. 
When she is here is polite and friendly and acts sweet. We know not to tell her too much because nothing is private with her, she complains we don’t visit her enough but we do try to stop in once a month if we can but my husband and I both work full time jobs, our kids all play sports and our evenings and weekends are filled with their events. 
It’s Christmas Eve and not a word from her or my father. The past week my children and myself have been hit hard with a flu. 
I am still not well and realized I never messaged my parents to tell them it might not be a good idea but my husband said to forget it. They can either show up or learn to communicate or I need to face the music they only show up because they feel obligated. It’s ridiculous because I feel the stress of the potential fall out for not messaging, I am sad because they truly don’t care. Do I need to take the hint? In my gut this feels like she is playing games of control. ",2024-12-25 02:50:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hls9tu/christmas_dilemma/,TwoXChromosomes,False

Massive_Hawk_7615,Do departments have to provide a reason as to why they failed you on the Background?,"I just got a notification from a department that I failed the background check and was removed from their list. From the few bits of information I was able to gather, it had to have been something in the early stages, as none of my references or neighbors claimed to have been contacted by this department. Thing is, I really can't think of anything that would be a red flag. I have no criminal history, no traffic or parking tickets, minimal student debt, no drug use, pretty standard grades with a degree, and a pretty standard work history for someone just out of college. This has me worried that there's something on my background that I'm not aware of that needs to be addressed. 

I've already tried reaching out to both the investigator and (on said investigator's recommendation) the Fire and Police Commission, who claimed that the reason behind the disqualification is confidential, even to me. However, I am aware that there are certain laws in the civilian sector that state that a company must be transparent with their reasons as to why a candidate failed a background check, as to give said candidate a chance to refute such reasons if they are false. Do those same laws and rights apply to police candidates, or is it different due to the police being a government entity rather than a private corporation? Just to clarify, I'm not looking to sue anyone over anything, as I'm not exactly heartbroken over loosing out on this department, just really want to know if there's anything funky going on with my background that I need to look into.",2024-12-23 04:40:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1hkg87p/do_departments_have_to_provide_a_reason_as_to_why/,ProtectAndServe,False

Black_Reactor,Two Greek shipping companies fined $3.4 million for dumping bilge into NJ waters,"Two Greek shipping companies will pay $3.4 million in fines after admitting their vessel’s crew dumped oily bilge water into the narrow shipping channel between New Jersey and Staten Island, then falsified records to hide it.

In addition to the fine, the U.S. Department of Justice ordered Avin International Ltd. and Kriti Ruby Special Maritime Enterprises, owner and operator of the offending Motor Tanker Kriti Ruby, to make a $1.1 million community service payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. 

The feds also sentenced the two companies to five years of probation “during which they will be subject to environmental compliance plans with a monitorship to ensure future compliance,” the justice department said in a statement.
Both companies pleaded guilty on Monday in federal court in Newark to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, falsifying records and obstruction of justice. 

The charges stemmed from two 2022 port calls, one of them at a petroleum terminal in the Sewaren section of Woodbridge, N.J., that September.
On orders from senior engineering officers, Kriti Ruby crew members bypassed legally required pollution prevention equipment and protocols to discharge the muck straight into the sea via the ship’s sewage system, prosecutors said. They left that detail out of the vessel’s oil record book and hid the pumps and hoses they used.",2024-12-25 08:08:07,https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/24/two-greek-shipping-companies-fined-3-4-million-for-dumping-bilge-into-nj-waters/,newjersey,False

This iactually a packet with dry spices in there and you just put in a pressure cooker or slow cooker and then the meat (st louis or baby back ribs), some garlic cloves, carrots etc . Make it a hearty meal for everyone in the family. In Asia you can just go to a hawker store or restaurant to eat i..... here it is different. Thanks.

i have several videos and witnesses to prove this harassment they even admitted that im on surveillance because i exercise at night time which makes no sense

They asked my relative can they speak me not enter the house they had a motive that didn’t work so they took the law in there own hands and did what they wanted you already asked me can you speak to me and I said no then they left there whole plan was to force me to a mental hospital because no laws have ever been broken and this is the 6th time they harassed me in the past year but they have never broke the law like this it’s not fair game once they enter they should’ve never entered and gave a false diagnosis to detain me even when you stand your ground against these crooks they still do what they want and get away with it ",2024-12-23 22:07:29,https://v.redd.it/rsqptcau8o8e1,policebrutality,False

Spotted one of the regular foxes in the garden, when they sat down in front of me which is a bit odd. On approach they collapsed, and made a feeble attempt to run when I was next to them before collapsing again. Collected them up and into a tub to get to Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital (poor thing was unable to control their bladder so unfortunately I also smell… really bad…). They were fairly unresponsive on route but regularly looked up at me. They’re there now on IV fluids and hopefully they’ll make it - I’ll find out in 2 weeks 😅

The biologist says he only knows of one breeding pair!

Iowa still has a fur trapping season for gray fox. https://www.iowadnr.gov/Portals/idnr/uploads/Hunting/huntingregs_card.pdf

Not only do they still allow trapping, but there isn’t even a bag limit for gray foxes!

I’ve been having debates in the conservation sub. In that sub any hint that hunters and trappers have too much power is met with anger. Yet this Iowa example is proof that these state agencies bend over backwards to accommodate the less than 1% of the population who want to kill foxes.

iminlovewithyoucamp,How many of you wish you were white and how do you deal that you will never be white or white passing?,"I know, it’s like I’m typing blasphemy, but it’s true. 

Currency 32M, I feel like since I was born an Oreo, I always felt like I’m not black enough to fit into white society, but I act to white to be accepted by black people. It feels like I’m all alone in this world.

All I wanted from my life as a child  was to be a diabetic camp counselor, marry the girl(s) who I felt like I loved from diabetic summer camp and hang out with my friends well into adulthood.

This didn’t happen though. 

I feel like I was cheated out of enjoyment of life because I am black.

If I was white, I would of gotten the  job as a camp counselor. I just know it deep down in my heart. 

If I was a white man or white woman, the white girls that I dated would have agreed to marry me.

Shit just didn’t work out. 

I bring this up now because my two long time 2 BFFs reached back out to me. We talk everyday now. I love them because I was taught as a child to love your diabetic brothers and sisters. I’m happy for my 2 BFFs that are now a couple. All I wanted fruit my friends was to be happy within their relationships. 

I just feel that my blackness stopped me from finding love.

I could just date a black woman and I currently have a FWB with a 21F black woman. I love her but she will never love me. 

I don’t think black woman can live a filthy, disgusting, whitewashed Oreo.

There is nothing about me that is a thug.

Black women only date thugs and I am not a thug so black women hate me or use me for money and then ghost me. 

I stopped believing in “god” a long time ago. 

I refuse to respect an entity that created an Oreo.

“God” should of made me either a thug or a full white persona.

TLDR: fellow black people, how do you deal that we will never be loved of accepted by the society we love the most?

\- Schema Design: ask to design and build an schema for a given use case using SQL, focusing on normalization and scalability

\- Query Optimization: Give a poorly performing query and ask them to analyze and optimize it, explaining their reasoning

\- Indexing: Present a table with real-world query scenarios and ask them to add or modify indexes to improve performance

Motor_Round_6019,Is This a Good or Bad Database Schema?,"I'm currently getting clowned on by my friends for having ""too many foreign keys."" I'm aware that you can reduce the number of foreign keys here, but the only table in this database that will be actively updated (and by that, I mean updating specific data and not just adding/removing columns) is the \`players\` table. Beyond that, everything else will just be added to. The ""staff"" table will also be updated every once in a while, but the only data that would be updated is the ""admin"" boolean. I'm also concerned about query time (as this is meant to be a generalized database structure shared amongst several different servers on a game) where there will be \*a lot\* of varying circumstances, so reducing the number of queries is one of my concerns. 

I think it should also be noted that ""uuid"" and ""permanent\_id"" are two completely different components. ""uuid"" is, in essence, just the ID sent from the player's client itself -- meanwhile, ""permanent\_id"" is the ID that the server uses to identify a player. This is done because the UUID of a player is \*extremely\* dangerous to share -- however, both staff and players needs a way to uniquely identify a player without imposing the danger, hence a server-side identification for the player. 

Are the number of foreign keys here bad practice? Additionally, is there a better way of reducing the number of database queries?

Additional_Strain713,"I am struggling with Database Design for my app, need some guidance","I'm working on a gaming duo connect buddy app where users can find and connect with others based on their gaming preferences. Currently i am only making the MVP and I'm stuck on how to structure my database, and I'd really appreciate some advice! I am always stuck with database things as i never understand how many tables i need according to app needs and I cant find a way to improve.

Here’s what I’ve got so far:

    I have a users table synced with Supabase Auth table via triggers. The users table includes columns like id, name, email, username, avatar_url, and bio.

Now, I need to let users add their game preferences. My initial thought was to add a `game_preferences` column to the `users` table as an array. But I’m concerned this might not scale well or make querying complex down the road?? ( i have no clue whats the optimal approach in this)

Another idea is to create a separate table, maybe something like `user_game_preferences`, where I can store game preferences in a many-to-many relationship (e.g., user\_id + game\_id). This feels cleaner, but I’m not sure if it’s the best approach.

I also plan to add features like:

* Letting users set preferences (rank, platform, favorite game modes, etc.).
* Showing users with similar preferences or potential buddies on the homepage.

my questions:

1. Should I go with a `game_preferences` array column in the `users` table or a separate table? What’s the more optimal approach?
2. How can I design the schema to handle additional data, like ranks, platforms, or game modes, without making the structure overly complicated?

I'm back in crypto and had some staked SGT (SharedStake) tokens that I think I unstaked via Etherscan. This then led to around 0.139 of vETH2 appearing in my ledger portfolio, however, im not sure how I can swap it to regular Eth so that I can buy other tokens.

From the basic research I did on 1Inch, it seems to only work with WETH?  So, do I have to convert my ETH into WETH first to do this?  Is that right?  What are things one should know before setting limit transactions?  Are they considerably more expensive than regular swaps or transactions?  Are there any inherant risks involved?

Horror_Tie6863,Stop accusing people of being racist because of slight movements they make in public ,"I want to start off by saying I am so so deeply sorry (as a very white passing mixed person), that you as POC’s struggle with feeling like this all the time and always feel like you’re being watched or accused. This request very much goes both ways. 

Please stop assuming people are scared or threatened by you because of slight movements such as moving a purse around or going to another aisle or doors locking in a car (most modern cars lock automatically once you start driving, and have for YEARS. So this one needs to end). 

I was shopping at the dollar store today for last minute stocking stuffers for my two children. I was struggling with OCD and anxiety from having too much caffeine, and feeling extremely self conscious through the very busy store. I turned down the toy aisle and there was 2 black women, each with their children. I tried to maneuver down the aisle and accidentally got in one of the women’s way, said “I’m so sorry” and moved out of her way and then leaned down to look at some puzzles. 

Now because I was feeling very self conscious, I kept feeling like my pants were falling down and like everyone could see my underwear. My side bag kept falling behind me and tugging my pants, making me more worried about this. It was also tugging on my neck and irritating it. I had adjusted my bag to the side of me and off my neck constantly from the moment I walked in. 

As I kneeled in this aisle, my bag swung behind me and I was feeling like my butt was showing off and anxious that there were people behind me probably seeing it. So I gently tugged my bag to the front/side of me again to not pull my pants down. 

Right after I did this, I hear one of the woman start saying… “mmm that girl was so nice. Mmhmm, I thought she was so sweet and then she go and do that. You saw that?”  

The other woman said no. She she continued. “You saw that girl move her bag away from us? Mmmhmm she was so sweet at first. Bless her heart”

I think I adjusted my bag another 50 times while in that store, overly anxious because I’m worried someone saw me do it the whole time. 

I’m so sorry that you feel targeted all the time. But accusing every slight and innocent movement a person makes isn’t the solution. 

And truly, truly, you do not deserve to put yourself through that self-induced mental anguish every single day of your life.",2024-12-23 21:06:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRacism/comments/1hkxfef/stop_accusing_people_of_being_racist_because_of/,AccidentalRacism,False

soer9523,"Watched the trailer for the Witcher 4, and I am sick of the obsession with lore. ","Maybe it’s just me, but in recent years I feel like a large part of the gaming community has become obsessed with lore to an extreme degree. I watched the trailer for the Witcher 4 and got really hyped about it, only to go online and see post after post, comment after comment complaining about how the game breaks the lore because women can’t be witchers, or Ciri should be more powerful and so on.

What the fuck happened to people having an Imagination. At what point did so many people collectively decide that when one thing was previously known or presented then its set in stone and can not, and should not be changed. No knowledge of a universe can ever be proven false or have exceptions. What happened to people being exited about new developments in a universe. Especially in fantasy where literal magic exists. But no apparently now lore has become a religion that must not be defiled, otherwise the devs are lazy, stupid and deserve scorn for ruining a game. It is frankly ridiculous. 

I know that in the Witcher universe it has been established that women can’t be witchers, but in a universe full of magic, people seemingly can’t fathom the idea that that might not always be true. Ciri is by no means an ordinary person and yet people fucking bitch and moan about cd project red breaking lore by making her a Witcher. Maybe wait until the game comes out see how and why she became mutated before making these claims. Have we considered that in universe people will often make claims based off limited knowledge. Did the people who concluded that women can’t be witchers consider children of the elder blood? I doubt it. 


Why do so many people have a need to lead with negativity, when we still know next to nothing about the game or its story.

Anamorsmordre,Help me find this really colorful horror game!,"I saw this indie game a while ago, it's a very colorful(I remember it having neon colours) horror/survival game with a demon lady/person as a sidekick and a unique weapon(I'm not 100% sure if it was an actual weapon) mechanic.

AutoModerator,Bookclub and Sources Wednesday!,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder,  also has a recommended list of things to read, listen to or watch",2024-12-25 12:00:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1hlzi96/bookclub_and_sources_wednesday/,history,False

Both armed robbers were killed, twelve police officers and eight civilians were injured, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police.

deleted,The future of XRP,"  
The chart looks insanely bullish. We can observe how the 2025 alt season is going to unfold, especially for XRP, which is being adopted by central banks worldwide. XRP will be globally adopted as a payment system, while Bitcoin serves as digital gold.

The strong XRP community has made it a top contender in the rankings, and it will continue to grow. The new year is going to bring very exciting opportunities within the XRP ecosystem, with the potential for it to be used as a global currency.

Parabolic price growth and appreciation are just months away.

JohnRamos85,"Joyeux Noel and Buon Natale, Olympics Reddit!!!","My dear fans, to all of you the millions of supporters of sports around the world, Merry Christmas. And why two greetings in different languages? The Olympics, that is, in France this year and in Italy in 2026.

It has been a momentous 130th year of the International Olympic Committee and the Winter Games Centennial and we are truly proud and thankful to everyone who came here during the games in Peyongchang and Paris who virtually cheered for all the competing athletes and national teams this year.

Now therefore we prepare for the 130th birthday of the Summer Games and to cheer for everyone playing in Milan-Cortino and in the return of the Summer Youth Olympics in Dakar.

This has been for the world of sports, especially to all recognized IOC disciplines, a year of great moments across the board, and all of us have been witnesses to many amazing memories of sporting action in Pyeongchang and Paris, all over France and in Tahiti. And all of us celebrated the many wonderful moments in all the other events held on this year across the world outside of the Games.

We thank all our retiring athletes of all sports for their service and dedication to the sport, their communities and countries, and all our champions from this year.

Now that we are at the final days of yet another Olympic Year, the time has come to pay our thanks to what has been a year to remember across the sporting world and get ourselves ready not just for yet another birthday of the Father of the Games, Baron Pierre de Courbertin, and to yet another great year of action all over the world, especially in the Olympic sports and recognized disciplines, in preparation for the Games of 2026 in Italy and Senegal. To all of you here, get that calendar ready, 2025 will be full of events to remember.

May the glad tidings of this season be upon us all!

For Glory

It’s been 6 weeks she’s home and she has peed every single day. Every single day. I’ve tried to many different tactics. Vet says she’s growing normally and told me she would stop this a couple weeks ago, but to be honest, last few days she doesn’t just tinkle a bit but rather empty her whole bladder. 

I tried to control her water intake, she still peed, I have her more water, she peed more. She always pees. No matter what. Vet didn’t say anything about a deformed bladder, but she’s still young so maybe.

ElReddo,Anamorphic DNG batch-desqueeze script - an Exiftool script for MAC & Windows to desqueeze all DNGs in a folder for correctly display in lightroom etc.,"Hi all!

I have a solution to batch process DNGs and add the exif data lightroom (and others) needs to display them desqueezed in library and develop modules.

After doing some rather painful research after buying a Sirui 24mm Anamorphic for photography with my XT-4 and finding either anirritating, slow lightroom > Photoshop > Lightroom workflow for desqueezing... or editing 'squeezed' in Lightroom, then desqueezing in post (yuck).

To solve the frustration I was having, I have written an automated ExifTool script for both MAC OS and Windows that automatically locates all the DNGs in the script's containing folder and writes the desqueezed pixel ratio into their EXIF data, allow lightroom to display them at the correct desqueezed aspect ratio in the DEVELOP module.

Super easy to run, just make sure you have Exiftool installed, pop the script file in the folder that contains your DNGs for processing (converting your RAWs to DNGs first is essential) then run the script (in windows) or drag the script into a terminal window (in MAC OS) and follow the prompts to enter your len's squeeze factor and off you go

The script allows you to enter your len's squeeze factor then confirms and batch processes everything it finds.

hopefully these streamline anyone fiddling with the pain of photo editing with squeezed anamorphic lenses and makes things little easier to process and edit!

Cheers all :D

weevilretrieval,how to deal with right-wing family members around the holidays?,"today, I had Christmas lunch with my extended family. I somehow got into a conversation with some older male relatives about politics. I don't really know how it started, but I remember my dad saying something about how he likes trump and elon musk (really silly because we don't even live in america). someone else said something about him being better than ""that d*mb communist woman"" (I believe they were referring to Harris). I interjected with something like ""she's the opposite of communist, she's literally right wing"". 

there was more nonsense for a while, Muslims, immigrants, something about the world economic forum? they spoke about that for a while, saying how horrible it is and how they all want to control and confine us to 15 minute cities and digital ID, etc. if im being honest, I know barely anything about whatever the hell they were talking about.

after that they talked about China and how ""horrible"" it apparently is, then they moved onto the USSR. I mentioned something about how life for a lot of people actually improved after the Bolshevik revolution, compared to before when it was an autocracy. an older male relative got quite pissed at me and said something like ""don't glorify it. it was horrible. they killed heaps of people that didn't deserve it"". I am not great at arguing with people, so I just said ""i never said it was perfect, im just saying that some things improved"".

idk, I just feel like I am horrible at trying to get my point across, and they all pretty much just agree with one another, so I feel pretty ganged up on.

anyway, thanks for reading if you did. if you have any advice, I would appreciate it. happy holidays also",2024-12-25 14:34:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hm1ro2/how_to_deal_with_rightwing_family_members_around/,socialism,False

KneeKappaTTVBTW,"New here, some questions about the VA disability if that’s okay","Hey everyone, 

I just wanted to get some clarification on my VA letters, when I was approved for my disability claim I was at 90% but my VA rep suggested pushing for P&T 100% while also applying for 100% IDU or whatever the unemployability is called.   So I got approved the 100% years ago but this whole time I've been trying to figure out exactly if it's p&t or unemployability.  Originally I thought my VA rep said it was for unemployability but I seem to have the same coverage that P&T does? (I was told P&T gets dental and unemployability doesn't, could be wrong though) 

But I also have VA letters certifying that I have ""a total or 100% permanent or total evaluation"". Would the letter specifically say unemployability or does this letter mean I have P&T?

Sorry if this is a common question.  ",2024-12-25 14:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/1hm1psb/new_here_some_questions_about_the_va_disability/,Veterans,False

GreenCucumber1677,Feeling Stuck with Repetive thoughts and No Hope,"I’m 18 and for as long as I can remember, I’ve been battling **OCD** along with **anxiety** and **depression**. Recently, it feels like everything’s caught up with me in a way I can’t handle. I’m trying to get better. I’ve been seeing a therapist for about a month and a half, doing **CBT** and **DBT**, and I’m on **medication (Fluvoxamine)** for my Repetitive Thoughts. I thought things would start to change, but right now, it feels like I’m just stuck.

It’s been hard. I’ve worked on leaving behind things that once helped me cope, like **gaming** or taking long naps,using my SmartPhone, but I’m still struggling with some deeper habits, like **porn**, that I can’t seem to shake off no matter how hard I try. I can’t help but feel like I’m failing, like no matter how many times I get up and keep going, it’s never enough.

There are days when I can’t even think of anything good about myself, and all I can see are the negatives. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop where no matter what I do, things just don’t feel better. I’ve been told by my therapist that this is the phase where I need to put in the work to accelerate the process, but I just don’t know how.

I know **therapy** and **meds** are supposed to help, but some days, it feels like I’m moving in slow motion. Does anyone here know what it’s like to feel like this? How do you push through when it feels like nothing’s changing? How do you find hope when the path ahead feels unclear?

If anyone has been through something similar or has advice on what’s worked for them, I’d really appreciate hearing it. I just need some perspective, because right now, I’m struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",2024-12-25 14:33:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1hm1r72/feeling_stuck_with_repetive_thoughts_and_no_hope/,mentalhealth,False

I can’t stand the way I look…years of exercise, hygiene and improving clothing have proven ineffective and i just seem too unattractive for people to put up with me…

Everything looks wrong…I lost the genetic lottery in every way imaginable bar visible birth defects…my face looks weird and awkward and despite almost being underweight like I am a goddamn hamster…my laugh and grin is a fucking nightmare. 

I hate how people treat me differently just because I’m not attractive…I hate how I’m the punching bag of people…I hate how invisible I am…I hate how people joke about it, I hate peoples just take me for granted…I never chose for this and I’m being punished for it. And I’m punishing myself for it…

I can’t help getting immensely frustrated by all this…how it’s unfair, how lonely it makes me feel, how others treat me for it and how shit it makes me feel…i know I can’t control it and I know I have to take peace with it…to ‘own’ my face but I can’t…

Select_Equipment_263,We both felt a shock on our foreheads at the same time while high. How is this possible?,"So, me and my friend were smoking weed and got pretty high. Out of nowhere, we both felt this shock-like sensation on the exact same spot on our foreheads at the exact same time. It wasn't just one of us saying it and the other agreeing-we both reacted in shock at the same time without saying anything first.

It felt real, like a physical jolt or pulse, and it happened simultaneously. We've been trying to figure out what this could mean or how it's even possible. Was it just the weed? A coincidence?

When the pandemic abruptly halted their wholesale baking business, Ms. Riddell and her then-business partner, Katie Lynch, pivoted, starting pop-ups to sell treats directly to the public on the building’s first floor. By 2022, Riddell had converted the space into a full-fledged bakery selling viennoiserie, as well as delicate canelés, cookies made with three types of ginger, and beautiful lemon tarts capped with torched meringue. The shop’s car lift and air pump remain — alongside velvet banquettes and a huge custom pastry case popping with some of the city’s best baked goods. REGAN STEPHENS

Obvious_Magazine620,"Why did Prophet Muhammad order the destruction of idols in the Kaaba in Mecca? Why did he allow the destruction of other Kaaba-like structures across Arabia? What right did Muslims have to do this, and isn’t it morally wrong considering the potential future implications?","I am interested in the history of religions, specifically the Abrahamic religions. I mostly watch *Let's Talk Religion* and other YouTube channels to gather information on the historical and archaeological perspectives of religions. Recently, I was watching *The Message* to learn about the emergence of Islam, and the scene where Muslims destroyed the idols housed within the Kaaba in Mecca struck me as deeply problematic. As far as I understand, this was a historical event.

There were also other Kaaba-like structures or shrines across Arabia and beyond that were reportedly destroyed on the orders of the Prophet, such as Dhul Khalasa. My contention is that the Kaaba in Mecca existed in pre-Islamic Arabia and was used by various tribes to house the idols of their gods. Pre-Islamic Arabians performed pilgrimages, also referred to as Hajj and Umrah. Mecca was the largest trading hub in Arabia and served as a neutral meeting point. This was the reality of Mecca and the Kaaba at that time. These people believed what their ancestors taught them, and to them, housing idols of their gods made sense and seemed like the right thing to do.

Then came a group of people led by the Prophet, who claimed that the Kaaba belonged to them because it had been built by Prophet Ibrahim and his son as a shrine to monotheism, but over time, people had turned to polytheism. It’s possible that other groups could have had similar claims about the Kaaba. However, aren’t these claims rooted in faith rather than historical evidence, considering there is no tangible proof that Prophet Ibrahim or his son ever existed or that they built the Kaaba?

Even if the Muslim account of the Kaaba's origin is true, how does that automatically grant Muslims the right to reclaim and repurpose a place of worship used by multiple tribes across Arabia thousands of years after Ibrahim’s time? Additionally, if we give the first Muslims the benefit of the doubt for repurposing the Kaaba in Mecca, what religious right did they have to destroy other Kaaba-like structures or shrines across Arabia?

Couldn’t the actions of the Prophet be used by future Islamic rulers or militants to justify the destruction of indigenous religions in territories they conquer?

\--

To cut it short, Why did Prophet Muhammad order the destruction of idols in the Kaaba in Mecca? Why was the destruction of other Kaaba-like structures across Arabia also permitted? Considering that these sites were important places of worship for various tribes, what justification did Muslims have for taking such actions, especially since these tribes were following traditions passed down for generations? Even if the claim that the Kaaba was originally built by Prophet Ibrahim is accepted, does this grant a right to reclaim it thousands of years later, particularly through the eradication of other religious practices? Isn’t this approach morally questionable, especially when considering how it might set a precedent for future actions, such as the destruction of indigenous religious sites by later rulers or militants in the name of faith?

arianuhhh,Need advice about Scientology ,"Hi, I am posting here to try and help my mom, whose friend has recently been indoctrinated in Scientology. Prior to the indoctrination, the friend told my mom multiple times that she did NOT want to be a part of the religion; she has been a practicing Christian her whole life until now and was extremely fearful of the religion as her kids became interested in it.

To explain further- the woman’s daughter became a Scientologist via her boyfriend, and the daughter converted her brother as well. Therefore, both of the woman’s children were now indoctrinated in the church. This caused the mom (my mom’s friend) to have a severe mental health crisis (she was pre-disposed to this condition) that both her kids had been indoctrinated into scientology. She couldn’t make sense of her children’s new faith, and for example, her son specifically suffered from severe anxiety, claimed that Scientology could now only solve it and that he would hurt himself if he could not practice. 

My mom and her group of friends have had interventions for her friend amidst her mental health crisis (she lost a serious amount of weight, stopped taking her anxiety meds, etc.). Her daughter essentially lied to my mom and her friends, saying her mom was going to a mental health rehab that was not affiliated with Scientology when, in fact, it was. When my mom and her friend spoke when she first entered “the mental health center,” the friend told my mom how scared she was and that they were trying to convert her. Now, she is fully indoctrinated. 

My mom is devastated. This is her friend of 40 years, and she knows that her friend was put up to this against her will. What advice can I give my mom at this time? I feel terrible about the whole thing.

Thank you in advance for your understanding- I am also not trying to bash any religion, but I hope I conveyed how the situation was unethical. ",2024-12-25 04:58:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1hlu3lh/need_advice_about_scientology/,religion,False

GotToBeAWarrior,Rescue Pups Need Homes ASAP,"I hate that I feel that I have to go to Reddit now to rehome these pups I rehabilitated but here I am. When I got them they smelled horrendous and they could barely walk! Raw paws, dirty, shy, and clearly malnourished. I was out working late that night where I travel a lot, and spotted them through the fog, piled on one another on the side of an old country road (Northeast Alabama about 30 min or so from the Georgia line). Within just a few days after treating them and bathing them and introducing small meals of high quality food my husband and I got them up and playing. Now they are like totally different dogs! Full of energy and they are definitely going to grow up to be beautiful. However for some reason I have not been able to find them homes. I started with a rehoming fee, then dropped it down quite a lot and now I’m considering not even having one. The main reason I wanted to do a rehoming fee was to help try to avoid them getting dumped again and to help get back some of the money I put into them. But I honestly just want them to go to homes that will treat them right after what they have been through. Idk what to do, I’ve tried many avenues online and in person and making calls. Any ideas? Or….is anyone one here interested in one? They might be 2.5 to 3 months old. They are a working dog like an Aussie or heeler or shepherd mixed with Pyrenees possibly, that’s my best guess.

Safe_Mission_3524,Unbiased Website development consultation services,"Hello, I have been in the web hosting, web development and digital marketing industry for quite some time and have gathered vast amount of experience. I currently do a full time job in the same industry but want to earn extra by offering consultation services for potential clients looking to get their business setup online.

Based on the below info, can you all suggest me if this is a good/bad idea and how much would I usually be charging on such cases?

1) gather complete details of the business model

2) Recommend improvements, explain the pros and cons of their current ideas, provide a working model, final report of what kind of companies they need to approach ( frelancers/agencies) etc.

I have seen many clients who had approached me to why their websites redesigned because the precious developer didn't meet their expectations but still charged a hefty amount and ripping off the client.

I currently do not have the time to develop websites as I am solo and can't afford to pay an in-house dev or another freelancer and constantly followup with them to get the job done on time with good quality.

So I am thinking of offering an unbiased consultation for getting a business setup online, suggest them working ideas, what to ask with a developer or an agency, approximate budget they need to be aware of, ongoing and future costs for server, maintenance etc.

For all the current website owners and future owners and my dear friends in the dev background, can you all share if this is a viable idea? If so, what should I be charging the client for a consultation? I am thinking of $25 USD for a 1-1 session for 1 hour which will include in-depth research and suggestions.

This amount is for international clients and I am based out of India, so I am thinking of charging around 500-1000 rupees for an hour of consultation as 500-1000 is considered a high fee for a consultation here in India.


I currently do not plan to recommend any specific agency/freelancer until I can vouch myself for their quality and how good their works are. Once I find some good agencies/freelancers, I have future plans to recommend them to the business owners and get a commission after a project is successfully started/midway.

I know that all agencies and frelancers offer initial consultation for free but most of them try to get as much as possible from the client and this creates a negative impression for the whole web development community and affects genuine developers who are really trying to help clients with reasonable pricing and high quality work.

I am thinking of initially promoting this through social, word of mouth, creating blog posts, commenting on similar forums/groups etc. I do not have a lot of budget for paid media at this point.

Please let me know if there are any suggestions/feedbacks. All negative suggestions are also welcomed and I don't mind if it appears rude/frank.

Thank you all folks.

 For all the web development folks out there, Let's make web dev an awesome community together🙌.",2024-12-25 11:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1hlyu0e/unbiased_website_development_consultation_services/,business,False

Give an exhale and take ten deep, slow breaths any time you feel stressed or anxious.

Stress is maintained in the body by hormones that are broken down by oxygen, and deep breathing brings lots of oxygen into the body.

Exhale first, because trying to inhale while your lungs are full of air can feel like you can't breath, which will just stress you out more.

Count the breaths because counting gets your higher brain functions working and puts you in a more rational state-of-mind.

Imagine the feeling of happiness and focus on it for as long as you can or, if you can, for as long as you like.

Feeling happy makes you feel happy and never feeling happy makes you never feel happy.

Neurons that fire together wire together, so if you never let yourself feel happy, your brain will eventually make it so that you can never feel happy.

Let yourself feel happy!

Are there any organizations that can help him navigate the insurance world and get the help he needs? He needs help as soon as possible and the only Medicaid application I found says it can take up to 90 days.

Tacoriffics,The head of maintenance at Stadium Lofts apartment complex in Indianapolis is a proud Nazi. He proudly showed me his SS hand tattoo.,"Had some maintenance done on my apartment and noticed the head guy had an SS hand tattoo. I asked what it was. He said just some lightning bolts. I said a ""siegsieg rune?"" He smiled, said yeah and, held it out again. I said you should get that covered up and he said to ""mind my own fucking business"" and left pretty pissed. I called my office and told them and they seemed to take it seriously but when I went into the leasing office they were smiling and discussing with the door open to the maintenance office. The other maintenance guy with him was covering for him too. So as far as I know, the people who have the keys to where I and my partner sleep are pissed off Nazis. I do not want my rent money going towards a Nazi's paycheck. And I feel the other tenants should know the guy who has the keys to their home believes in racial superiority. Can y'all help me raise awareness of this?

Edit: r/indianapolis took down my post saying the same thing I said here. Take that as you will.

Edit 2: Too many folks saying I should hurt or kill this guy. Unless he hurts someone the discourse should only be about spreading the word that a guy who has access to peoples homes is a proud Nazi. Do not advocate violence unless against an initial violence.",2024-12-24 17:20:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/1hli2rd/the_head_of_maintenance_at_stadium_lofts/,Indiana,False
ThinkInSolitude,Job burned down - advice?,"Hi all! 👋 

My job burned down this morning and I'm extremely distraught. 🥺

I'm trying to cover all my bases, so I was hoping the community could help guide me in ways I'm already thinking and hopefully in ways I haven't thought of yet.

Does unemployment expedite cases where a tragic displacement happens? If not, how long does it typically take to process, what are the usual qualifications, and how much is the payout? I'm just worried because I was fairly new there and don't want to be denied for not working there long enough. 

Any and all other kinds of advice to help me keep my head above water during the holidays and these trying times would be much MUCH appreciated. 

Bless you all and happy holidays. ",2024-12-25 01:57:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/1hlrhli/job_burned_down_advice/,Indiana,False

This is mainly because we both are international students and didn't know about this. I had outstanding bill of $101 in the old account that was due in Jan. However, the old account just added $50 more to the bill once my new account was active even though the due date is in January. Am I missing something?

sammisshhh,Help Me Find Everything Online Made by Women! 🌸,"Hey everyone!

I’m on a mission to discover *everything* online that’s made by women or led by women. Whether it’s a groundbreaking AI (even if it works “okay-okay,” it’s totally fine! 😂), a shopping platform, beauty products, a search engine, a browser, a chatting platform—**anything and everything created or co-founded by women.**

If you’re using something made by women or if you’re a co-founder of something amazing, please share it! I just had this realization that women supporting women in every field could truly change the game. 💪

A friend of mine mentioned how society’s beauty standards were created to keep women occupied with looks rather than “important” matters like politics, finance, or tech. Isn’t that just wild? Not trying to offend anyone, but it got me thinking—women need to uplift and support each other in **all** areas: finance, social, political, economic, technological, environmental, legal—EVERYWHERE. 

So, if you know of:

* A finance app/platform by women
* A social media space led by women
* Women-driven initiatives in tech
* Female-founded marketplaces or apps
* Anything else you think aligns with this goal

**Let me know!** I’ll start using these platforms immediately because change starts with action. Let’s build and amplify this network together. 

Looking forward to your recommendations! 🙌",2024-12-25 04:34:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1hltrb8/help_me_find_everything_online_made_by_women/,Feminism,False

rubber_chicken777,[coming out] nonbinary AFAB teen looking for coming out advice,"i've recently fully embraced my genderqueerness and started doing things to help with some discomfort. i'm not sure how long i can wait to come out to my parents, let alone the rest of my family.

CONTEXT: i'm an out and proud lesbian. my family accepts this and talks about it about as normally as any mildly accepting family would. trans issues, though, are a different story. my father often speaks of trans people negatively whenever it's brought up, and my mother tends to be uncomfortable at the mention of anything other than men or women existing. case in point, earlier today we were baking cookies as a family and we joked, ""here's the cookie, go ahead and sprinkle him,"" ""but what if theyre a she,"" and i said ""what if it's a *they*?"" and my mother took an awkward amount of time to respond. she said ""our cookies are only girls and boys.""
i've overheard plenty of times things like, ""you changed that child's diapers, you know what they are"" referring to my dad's genderfluid sibling. so there's definitely negative feelings towards that kind of topic.

i have little to no dysphoria body-wise, nor to words really cause discomfort. i have preferences for gender neutral terms but am okay with any. i have tried a few things out, and would like access to more chest binding methods and more androgynous clothing. i'm not financially independent yet so i can't get it myself. my parents would never kick me out, i know that, but i'm terrified of what they might say to me if i told them i'm nonbinary. they've reacted negatively to the topic before and i'm worried they will again.

TL;DR: parents are okay with me being a lesbian but have said and done mildly transphobic things in the past. i'm nonbinary and would like to get more binders (i only have one as of right now), but i can't unless i tell them i want some.

should i come out to my parents at all? and if i do, what would be the best way to get them to understand my position? thanks for reading.",2024-12-24 06:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/comments/1hl7cmx/coming_out_nonbinary_afab_teen_looking_for_coming/,LGBTeens,False

treesofthemind,Annoying situation in France,"This is just a quick one but something I’m quite upset about. Just a PSA to everyone - keep receipts when you shop. Even in the 21st century apparently … I bought like 4 euros worth of stuff in a small supermarket, and then I walked further on and went into another larger supermarket (Carrefour) to get a few more items, as I knew they would be shut the following day (Christmas). They made me open my bag because apparently it beeped, and said I had to pay for the items in there again, even though I already bought them.

I used the Starling bank app which showed the transaction, I showed this to the cashier but she didn’t seem to think it was valid… in 2024? We use online payments on our smartphones, we don’t mess around with receipts. Then they said it should be showing 5 euros instead of 4 pounds… Starling does international currency conversion. How do they not know this?! Anyway it was really annoying. Starling shows the date/time and location of the transaction, so I clearly wasn’t lying.

Luckily it was only 4 euros worth, but still I’m super annoyed. Like why would I steal something that’s only worth 4 or 5 euros, can you be serious please? Obviously there must have been something wrong with the way the previous shop scanned it, I don’t know. Either way it felt like they were victimising me, they were really rude and even accused me of having stuff in my jacket (I didn’t obviously, undid it to show them).

Maxsyrup,"Weird experience with booking.com: hacked, scammed or error in their system?","Hi, I've just had a weird experience with booking.com and wonder if anyone has experienced anything similar. First, some background. I'm a very occasional user of booking.com. I have only used it 3 times during the past 7 years to book hotels. Last time was 2022 and the last time I was logged in on the site was at least a year ago. And no one else than me has access to my computer or phone. Also, I have never stayed at a hotel in Turkey (visited once 10 years ago, but did not stay at a hotel).

On the night of the 23:rd, I noticed I had a couple of emails from [booking.com](http://booking.com) in my inbox. Some of them were in Swedish (I'm Swede), some of them were in Turkish. Apparently a booking had been made on my account for a single night at a hotel in Istanbul for December 24 - December 25 (the single least likely night during the whole year that I would book a hotel - I always spend Christmas at home with my family). My credit card had also been charged with two transactions; €57 with matched the amount in the emails, and a second transaction of €113, which perhaps is a deposition?

I logged in to [booking.com](http://booking.com) and noticed right away that I didn't have password login enabled (which should be a good thing, security-wise), so I logged in using a one-time code sent to my gmail account. Once logged in, I could see right away that there was indeed a booking that matched the emails. For support regarding the specific booking, there was a chat option where you can reach out both to the hotel and to support at [booking.com](http://booking.com), so I wrote to both of them. The hotel replied within minutes: ""Ok, maybe you've been hacked then, we'll mark it as a no-show"".

The support of [booking.com](http://booking.com) didn't answer me during the evening, so I called them the next day on the 24th. I first tried the Swedish support number, but they were apparently out of agents. Next I tried the British one, and to my surprise I didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes before I got to talk to support. I explained the situation, and his response was: ""Ok, so as far as I understand it, you'd like to cancel this reservation without any extra charge?"" A bit annoyed, I replied: ""Sure, that would be great, but I'm also wondering how someone possibly could make a booking on my account?"". He replied with: ""Ok, I will also file a ticket to the security team, does that sound good?"" And then we basically ended the call.

A couple of hours later, I got a new couple of emails. These were also in Turkish, so I translated them using ChatGPT. Apparently my request to cancel the appointment without any extra charge had been denied. I was advised to cancel the appointment myself at the account page, which would cost me $50 (I believe).

So at this point I decided it was no point in taking it any further with booking.com. I blocked my credit card with my credit card company (the card was by the way **not** listed among the saved payment methods on my account page at booking.com) and I have now disputed the two transactions with my credit card company. This is the first time ever I've done this, after being a daily credit card user for the past 20 years (I do all my grocery shopping with credit card for cash-back) .

So, has anyone had a similar experience? If my account was hacked, why would they only use it for a single night at a relatively cheap hotel? And could they even do that, isn't the hotel required to check the passport to make sure it matches my name? Or could it be some fishy behaviour by the hotel itself, assuming they have some extra access and privileges at booking.com? Or was it simply an error in the system, where a booking (presumably by a Turkish person with the Turkish language set in their preferences) somehow ended up on my account?",2024-12-25 09:27:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hlxlhr/weird_experience_with_bookingcom_hacked_scammed/,travel,False
Lucky_Weakness_456,"First solo trip in Central America - where to go for nature, beaches and tranquility?","Hi everyone,

I’m planning a 2-3 week trip in February or March to Central America and would love some advice. I’m a 42-year-old solo female traveler from Europe with decent Spanish skills, this would be my first time in the region.

I prefer tranquil, quiet places over partying or big crowds. I would not stay in hostels as I can't sleep there :) I always enjoy meeting people and connecting with locals though. My most memorable travel experience was hiking in the Himalayas in Nepal, I’m a bit more drawn to nature than culture - but I wouldn’t want to skip cultural highlights entirely. 

I’d also love to see wildlife, spend a few days relaxing at a beach, and go snorkeling. Initially, I considered Costa Rica, but after researching, it seems a bit (too) touristy and expensive. Then, I thought about Panama (including San Blas), but I’ve also read wonderful things about Guatemala and combining it with Belize for beaches and snorkeling. Other options I’m considering are Honduras with Roatán or Nicaragua with the Corn Islands. I'd love to explore them all but I can't get enough holidays for now :) Safety is of course my consideration too.

Given my interests and travel style, which of these destinations would you recommend?

ThatsARockFact1116,Christmas Eve miracle pup,"I’ve talked about Ollie here and there before, but let me tell you about how this dog just shaved a few years off my life. 

We live on a small lake and Ollie enjoys running the geese off the property. She chases, they fly and she enjoys a fresh goose poop before I grab her or she comes running back.

Yesterday she realized that she could walk on the edge of the lake and I saw her hesitate for a split second before hauling ass ON THE ICE after them. They flew, and the ice broke (see the circled spot) . A neighbor saw from the window and called 911, and grabbed his kayak, but the lake was too frozen for him to get in. After a few excruciating minutes she floundered around. I took off my shoes and coat but since I weigh significantly more than 50lbs I was pretty sure that I’d just fall immediately and I wouldn’t be able to get to her anyway. 

Thankfully, just when it seemed that she was getting too tired to keep it up, she managed to pull herself out and run back (photo of the hole and her paw prints 😭 from this morning). At which point she tried to play with my neighbors’ dog. A quick run down in a warm shower, dry towels and a warm blanket and she was back to her idiot self. Thank goodness. And no more off leash in the yard for the foreseeable future or she at least moves beyond her 7 mo teenage rebellion. JFC

OfACritcalMind,Christian “friend”  got mad that her Cousins NDE experience &  “divine” intervention didn’t convert me….,"Long story short: -—>My friends cousins car went up in flames because of water diluted gas from circle k , this week. She survived!! And my friend got angry with me while recalling the events because  I don’t believe god “saved” her and that I’m still atheist😒…Read on 4 more details ⬇️ 


So I’m a naturalist, atheist skeptic , full stop. A friend of mines cousin stopped to get gas from circle K and it was water diluted according to news reports. And it went really bad . 

There are news reports that a  couple local gas station has or/had water diluted gas and caused countless of  people’s cars to become non functional. On the news witnesses said dozens of cars broke down at about the same time after getting the gas.

Her cousin also got gas from the same station. But she was able to keep driving somehow. However the car was a ticking time bomb! She noticed her car having problems accelerating , the car would not accelerate past about 45mph  and it was shaking. Misfiring. Typical signs water is in your gas tank according to my brief research. This wasn’t the point where she decided to stop either. She kept driving it. She just figured she could make it home . But once she noticed smoke coming through the vent she called her boyfriend to look at her car once she got back home and told them her car was emitting smoke through the vent. At that point she was going to try to make it to the rest stop and park. But she changed her mind (she says god did) and pulled to the median instead . As she was pulling over , the smoke got black and thick and suddenly there was a flame coming from the glove comparent.She jumped out!!! She says not even a full minute later the car went up in flames . So far nothing divine or supernatural has appeared in this story.  But I guess Christian’s think having a change of mind is of god and only Christians do it?? 

Imo, the decision not to keep going, even with just the “regular” smoke coming through the vent, was common sense. Not god talking to her, at all. So my friend says again that god directed her cousin to stop driving. And I told her “I assure you, that most atheists would have probably parked it even sooner. Because we tend to be logical. The car was showing signs of trouble.” 

Especially as a very vigilant and paranoid person. I would have already parked my car when it started shaking and wouldn’t accelerate. Not keep driving another mile.

It doesn’t take divine intervention to recognize that is a problem sign . But she says “god” lead her to change her mind and stop sooner. 

What further solidified her “realization” that divine intervention had definitely occurred, she said, is that a woman who I assume is friends with her cousin told her cousin that “god saved you. And you would have died if he didn’t tell you to pull over at that median honey.” The cousin claims this lady wouldn’t have otherwise known that detail about her stopping at the median, because she wasn’t there?? Idk!! 🤷‍♀️ 

After going over all of this , my friend said that I should surely be able to recognize divine intervention  took place and  that god is surely real. And I said no. She got offended immediately and said that it was traumatic for her cousin and that I’m questioning her lived experience in a disrespectful manner because clearly god had influenced her cousin to stop driving the car. 

I said that her cousin had taken the proper precaution just in time and I’m happy she’s safe but for me , there’s nothing there that would make me believe in a god. I said her cousin is free to interpret changing her mind at the last minute as divine intervention. I can’t do a thing about that and don’t care. But I’m firmly atheist and not superstitious. 

Everything “major” that happens in that tiny town is breaking news quickly because it’s so small‼️and within 2 hours tops, anything juicy, salacious or shocking has already reached the ears of most of the town!! It’s really not surprising or odd at all if someone A) already was told the news or B) also credits “god” that she lived C)inferred parts of what happened from whatever clues and info they had. 

 Christian’s normally attribute common sense “intuition” to a god so it doesn’t take a superpower for a religious person to jump to that conclusion. I was tired of talking about it at this point. So I said either way, this was an unfortunate series of events and I’m glad she’s safe. She was still clearly annoyed and unsatisfied with my answers and that I was unconvinced of the supernatural involvement .

But really, am I being blind here?? Am I just refusing to see his holy light?? Is this a clear cut case of gods guiding hand?? Is changing one’s mind about continuing to drive a car that is clearly malfunctioning and having a gas/engine problem , really that shocking?! To the point of claiming that god “told” you to discontinue?? 

As a true crime “fanatic” , I am aware of a case where a crazed evil man really hates his neighbors. He was a religious zealot and hated everyone . He was a serial arsonist and murdered two neighboring families while they were asleep in bed . One of the families had multiple children, all died in the fire. Where was their intervention? Why didn’t god see fit to save those children from suffocating and burning to death at the hands of a madman?? How come they didn’t get a “sixth sense” to wake up and escape before he set their houses ablaze?? 🥴🤢

Anyway! , I CANT deal with someone trying to force me to abandon reason and common sense . So just like that our friendship is done ✌🏾😘

Her cousin being cognizant enough to exit a burning vehicle doesn’t point to divine intervention for me💔 ",2024-12-25 12:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1hm09vh/christian_friend_got_mad_that_her_cousins_nde/,atheism,False

On paper Myles fits perfectly on this team, elite shot blocking, can hit the 3 ball and is also a lob threat. The only thing that would get  worse is rebounding, 'cause Myles isn't that great at it for some reason despite being nearly 7ft tall.

I also know many Warriors fans like Kuminga and think that he can really be something, and I don't doubt that but I don't think he can reach that with the Warriors.

But when a co-founder of Bitcoin.com said that investing in this cryptocurrency was ""the most extreme investment that could ever exist""…  Just imagine what can happen if the China situation repeats. Now, it's time to withdraw your investments from bitcoin and invest in mining projects. A few of my friends, after the news about Emil Oldenburg, also sold bitcoins and invested in the project I use MininigNow (https://miningnow.online/). They`ve secured their investments, and I, as a member of the bounty program, will receive 3% for each friend brought to the project.",2017-12-20 20:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_failkate/comments/7l48ut/the_bitcoin_fall/,u_failkate,False
failkate,Different kind of programmers,"For some reason, the programmers who spend their time on all sorts of forums have a very strange impression about mining projects. They believe that people who invest in projects don`t understand anything, they`re not able to host a home farm and therefore invest. And they receive very small profits. As for me, I totally disagree with these points, because such projects were created in order to make mining accessible to everyone who wants to do it. Let`s, e.g., consider MiningNow. They created their product so that it fits both beginners and experienced IT specialists. People who take their first steps in blockchain can better find out details, and those who already know all that can learn about the equipment that was specially created for MNW. So, when I read such posts about mining, I immediately argue.

failkate,"Development in ""non-stop"" mode","Many are trying to find the most effective way to distinguish scam projects from good companies that never disappear from the market with investments. Someone uses the principle of ""direct transfers"": if it`s possible to invest in a project with a direct transfer without transferring money to cryptocurrencies, this project`s considered to be reliable. I found another way to make sure your money`s safe. We need to study the income distribution: if a project guarantees more than 60% of income to investors, it`ll have too little budget (or it won`t exist at all) to increase generating capacities. If they don`t do that, such a projects will disappear very quickly, and you risk losing your investments. In this respect, MiningNow that promises to its tokens` owners 30%, looks very promising and reliable, and the rest goes to the development of the project. You can read about it on their website, on the blog: https://miningnow.online/en/blog. Upgrade in non-stop mode! Here`s the guarantee that you`ll receive regular profits!

cutycutyhyaline,The crisis in South Korea is not over yet. ,"I have been written below. I've been posting this to Avaaz and Change.org. If you're okay with that, please read this and sign. Why I post on this subreddit, is just I want to let you know what is going on in South Korea. Gaining your sign is secondary to me.  
**Please stop the Nazis from resurrecting in South Korea.**  
**나치가 한국에서 부활하는 것을 막아주세요.**  
I know that the illegal martial law that happened in South Korea shocked the world.  
나는 한국에서 일어난 한국의 불법 계엄이 전 세계에 충격을 주었다는 것을 알고 있습니다.

I think the reason it is shocking is because it happened in an advanced democratic country,  
이것이 충격적인 이유는, 이런 일이 선진적인 민주주의 국가에서 일어났었기 때문이며,

and because it makes you think this could happen in your country too.  
여러분이 살고 있는 국가에서도 이런 일이 일어날 수 있을 것이라고 생각하게 만들었기 때문이라고 생각합니다.

The risk has not disappeared yet.  
위험은 아직 사라지지 않았습니다.

The judiciary of South Korea is deliberately not making a clear statement about this illegal martial law.  
한국의 사법부는 고의적으로 이번 불법 계엄에 대한 입장을 명확히 발표하지 않고 있습니다.

Also, the Korean media is publishing articles suggesting this illegal martial law may be legal.  
또한, 한국의 언론 역시 이 불법 계엄이 합법적일 수도 있다고 암시하는 기사를 내보내고 있습니다.

This is contributing to the ruling party in South Korea claiming that the illegal martial law is legal and to the government in South Korea delaying the investigation into the illegal martial law.  
이는 한국의 여당이 불법 계엄을 합법적이라고 주장하는 것과, 한국의 행정부의 불법 계엄에 대한 조사를 지연시키는 것에 기여하고 있습니다.

All of this is happening by legally abusing the laws that are supposed to protect the values ​​that we hold dear.  
이 모든 일들은, 우리가 중요하게 생각하는 가치들을 보호하기 위한 법률들을 합법적으로 악용하여 벌어지고 있습니다.

We have seen in the 20th century that those who wish to destroy democracy have done so by using the tools of democracy legally. This was the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany, which led to the catastrophe of World War II.  
우리는 민주주의의 파괴를 원하는 자들이, 민주주의의 도구를 합법적으로 이용하여, 이를 달성하는 것을 20세기에 본 적이 있습니다. 독일의 나치의 집권이 그것입니다. 이는 2차 대전이라는 재앙으로 이어졌습니다.

If the illegal martial law in South Korea is successfully justified, the impact on the world could be very serious.  
한국의 불법 계엄이 정당화되는데 성공할 경우, 이 일이 전세계에 미칠 영향은 대단히 심각할 수 있습니다.

If this attempt succeeds, the forces that attempted to impose illegal martial law will regain enormous political power.  
이 시도가 성공하게 된다면, 불법 계엄을 시도했던 세력은 엄청난 정치적 권력을 다시 손에 넣게 될 것입니다.

Fascists who seek to overthrow democracy around the world will try to emulate this. Those who prefer violence to world peace will also try to imitate this.  
전 세계의 민주주의를 전복하려는 파시스트들은 이를 모방하려 할 것입니다. 세계의 평화보다 세계의 폭력을 더 선호하는 사람들 역시 이를 모방하려고 할 것입니다.

The investigation of the Korean National Assembly has found evidence that the forces that attempted illegal martial law attempted to cause armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.  
한국 국회의 조사에 의하여, 불법 계엄을 시도한 세력이 한반도의 무력 충돌을 발생시키려 했다는 증거들이 발견되고 있습니다.

At a time when the world is suffering from the unfortunate events that are happening in Ukraine, if the forces that have tried illegal martial law are recognized as politically justified, they will try to start armed conflicts again to gain more power.  
우크라이나에서 일어나고 있는 불행한 일에 전 세계가 고통받고 있는 이 때, 불법 계엄을 행한 세력이 정치적 정당성을 인정받게 된다면, 이들은 더욱 큰 권력을 가지기 위하여 다시 무력 충돌의 발생을 다시 시도할 것입니다.

If this happens even in Northeast Asia, I think it will lead the world down a path of no return.  
동북아시아에서마저 이런 일이 발생한다면, 나는 이것이 전세계를 돌아올 수 없는 길로 이끌 것이라고 생각합니다.

Remember, even the United States failed to recognize or prevent this illegal martial law in advance. They will continue to repeat extreme actions to strengthen their power.  
미국조차도 이 불법 계엄을 사전에 인지하거나 막지 못했다는 점을 상기해주십시오. 그들은 자신의 권력을 강화하기 위해 극단적인 행동을 계속 반복할 것입니다.

At a time when democracy and peace are threatened more than ever around the world, this issue is no longer just a Korean issue.  
민주주의와 평화가 세계적으로 그 어느 때 보다 위협 받고 있는 이 때에, 이 문제는 더 이상 한국만의 문제가 아닙니다.

I believe that the judgment of the South Korea Constitutional Court and the South Korea Judiciary on this illegal martial law will have a serious impact on the fate of the entire world.  
나는 이 불법 계엄에 대한 한국 헌법재판소와 한국 사법부의 판단이, 전 세계의 운명에 심각한 영향을 미칠 것이라고 생각합니다.

A few centuries ago, this kind of problem would have had to be solved by military force.  
몇 세기 전이었다면, 이런 종류의 문제는 군사력에 의해 해결될 수 밖에 없었을 것입니다.

But today, we can do better by proving how many people see this issue as important.  
하지만 오늘날, 우리는 이 문제를 중요하게 보고 있는 사람의 수가 얼마나 많은지 입증하는 것으로 대신 할 수 있습니다.

Please show the Constitutional Court of Korea and the Korean judiciary that you do not want the illegal martial law in Korea to be justified in the name of law.  
한국 헌법재판소와 한국 사법부에, 당신이 한국의 불법 계엄을 법의 이름으로 정당화되는 것을 바라지 않는다는 것을 보여주십시오.

Show the Korean government that you do not want them to deliberately delay the investigation into the illegal martial law.  
한국의 행정부에게, 불법 계엄에 대한 조사를 고의로 지연시키지 말기를 바란다는 것을 보여주십시오.

Tell them that you will not tolerate them exploiting the loopholes of our legal system.  
그들이 우리의 법 시스템의 허점을 이용하는 것을 용납하지 않을 것임을 말해주십시오.

Furthermore, let us warn those who would seek to destroy our democracy, using the tools meant to defend democracy, in the name of legality, that we are watching.  
나아가, 우리의 민주주의를, 민주주의를 수호하기 위한 도구들을 사용하여, 합법의 이름으로 파괴하려는 자들에게, 우리가 지켜보고 있다고 경고해주십시오.

우리는 민주주의 국가에서 일어나는 자기파괴적인 법적 집행들에 반대해야 합니다.

According to an announcement by Acting Minister of National Defense Kim Seon-ho, armed South Korean military operatives whose operational objective was to blow up South Korean or American military facilities in order to incite armed conflict and make it look like an attack by North Korea or China returned and turned in their weapons on December 24, a very long time after the illegal martial law was imposed.  
김선호 한국 국방부 장관 직무대행의 발표에 따르면, 무력 충돌을 발생시키기 위하여, 한국군의 시설이나 미군의 시설을 폭파시켜, 북한이나 중국의 공격인 것으로 위장하는 것이 작전목적인 한국군 소속 무장 첩보 요원들이  불법 계엄이 일어난지 아주 오랜 시간이 지난 때인 12월 24일에 복귀하여 무장을 반납했다고 합니다.

The investigation revealed that the South Korean generals who participated in the illegal martial law were under the command of a former general who had been dishonorably discharged.  
불법 계엄에 참여한 한국군 장성들은, 불명예 퇴역한 전직 장성의 지휘를 받았다는 수사 내용이 발표되었습니다.

Still, there is a possibility of danger that has not yet been revealed. The ruling party in South Korea is still buying time. In the meantime, there could be a movement of the South Korean military to attack the South Korean military itself or the South Korean people.  
여전히, 아직 밝혀지지 않은 위험의 가능성이 존재합니다. 한국의 여당은 여전히 시간을 끌고 있습니다. 그 사이에 한국군이 한국군 자체를 공격하거나 한국 국민을 공격하려는 움직임이 있을 수 있습니다.

I ask you all to hope that nothing more terrible happens in South Korea.  
여러분들이 한국에 더 끔찍한 일이 벌어지지 않기를 희망해주시길 부탁합니다.

Living-Purpose6802,"I have strong feelings about the new attendance law in this state, so I wrote an essay on it.","Actually a persuasive speech, but I digress. 

I spent most of November in the hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding. When I finally got back to school, I was going to all my teachers for missing work, and it just so happened that that week, last week, was the day students were giving persuasive speeches in my LA class. I absolutely didn't have to submit one, being I was gone for the better part of two months, but I said, ""Oh, no. I'd like to do one. I already have a topic.""

A fun little story, but when I was in the ICU, November 12th, I opened my school laptop and found out I was counted absent for my first period class, and was on the verge of truancy. I messaged my counselor, and was told I needed a note if I wanted the absence excused. This was while I was awaiting ABDOMINAL SURGERY TO FIX MY BLEEDING ISSUE, BECAUSE I HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD THE PREVIOUS DAY I ALMOST DIED. I angrily told my counselor as such and she said it didn't matter. I still needed a note. 

Fueled by my fury at this, and a few other similar situations that have happened throughout the semester, which included me having to pull tons of strings to get a note to excuse me the first time I started seriously bleeding and almost died, and being told by a higher-up flat out that I was lying and ""wasn't actually sick and needed to stop being lazy"", I proceeded to write a six page persuasive speech in two days, detailing everything wrong with the new attendance law, the adverse effects, and subtly cursing out every single government official who signed the stupid thing into fruition. When I first started writing it, it was in all caps and included enough swears and slurs to get me suspended for the remainder of the semester. I was so angry, I was slamming my hands on my poor keyboard. I eventually cooled down enough to make a concise argument. A good amount of the sourcing I used was from my own experience and my little brothers experience, but I didn't have to look too hard for other testimonials. I even found some on this subreddit. This only made me angrier. 

When I stood up to give my speech last Friday, I was so consumed by icy rage that I didn't stutter, I didn't shake. It didn't occur to me to be nervous. At some points in the speech it devolved into me forcefully gritting my teeth and clenching my fists in an attempt to stop from completely losing it and shouting out my hate for this law. By the time I was done, I just slammed my speech script down on the table at the front of my classroom and walked away. I had quite a few of my classmates come up to me and tell me ""that was awesome. You should totally become a practitioner of law."" 

That got me thinking that there might be more I can do about this than write a six-page angry essay in two days and only present it to my LA class. This law is unfair, negatively impacts so many people, and isn't even that effective. There needs to be more incentive than just ""face criminal prosecution"", one that truant kids actually care about, and one that doesn't CALL OUT AND SHUN SICK KIDS WHO ARE TRYING THEIR FREAKING BEST BUT NOOO THEYRE SO INCONSIDERATE AND IRRESPONSIBLE LIKE SORRY FOR GETTING A LESION IN MY STOMACH AND HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A MONTH THAT WASNT COOL AS IF IT WAS MY CHOICE AND I *WANTED THIS*!!!! THINK AGAIN, YOU CONSTIPATED LAWNMOWERS!!!!!!

Sorry. Angry caps. 

If nothing is done to amend this law by the end of the semester, and I mean, SERIOUSLY amend it, me and a few friends are going to start a petition to get it amended or even abolished entirely. People may not think I can do much, as one sick 16-year-old, but I can do a lot more than just yell at people about my issues. There are a lot more six-page essays where that came from. And HECK if you think I'm gonna stop at six pages. 

If you're interested in signing our petition or helping out in any way, let me know. Its more than appreciated. 

Merry Christmas, y'all.

Tl;dr, attendance law has been screwing me over for months, I became Hamilton and wrote a six page persuasive speech about it, I was told I'd make a good lawyer, I'm starting a petition to do something about attendance law, contact me if interested.

Calm-Masterpiece-177,Seeking advice (again).,"(I am coming back after complaining and getting advice here a while ago) I currently live at an apartment complex in Mt. Vernon and am having quite some difficulties getting out of a lease, and reached out to OTA but they basically said there's nothing they can do (they read my lease too). 

There's significant detail on what happened but I want to avoid 1. doxing myself and 2. overwhelming y'all with too much information. But I need a Plan B now to get out of this lease– I'm contacting Legal Aid DC and the DC Small Claims Court to see if either can help. But would anyone know of additional resources for this? 

The apartment management is horrible and other residents have complained but nothing has happened and nobody cares enough to want to leave the way I do. I signed this lease while being in a somewhat emergency and therefore I didn't thoroughly check which is all my fault, I get it. And with school, I was even more overwhelmed and I did not get the other residents' contact. I could've made a group to figure out what could be done together for all of us. I feel unsafe and at risk, while living here, it's genuinely too unhealthy for me (physically AND mentally) at this point. I don't know if having those s\*\*\*\*dal thoughts has any kind of legal grounding but I'm willing to even declare that because it is literally the truth, I get horrible thoughts while being in my apartment and have had to stay out of it for hours and hours. 

  
Apologies in advance if I'm overwhelming DC residents with all the complaining here but I'm truly stuck and overwhelmed to the point where I don't know what to do next. ",2024-12-25 11:39:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1hlz8t1/seeking_advice_again/,washingtondc,False

XBXJetBlaqq,My beloved cafe needs a Christmas Miracle,"Hey Orlando, I hope the holiday finds you well.

Some of you may not know but College Park Cafe is one of Orlando’s oldest diners, serving guests for over 50 years. On Christmas Eve there was a kitchen fire that unfortunately caused my beloved College Park Cafe to temporarily close their doors for business.

Current owners Joey & Alan are doing everything they can to try and put the pieces back together so that they can reopen their doors to serve their wonderful community and as of right now they are unsure how long that could take. As you can imagine the fire completely destroyed their kitchen, the very thing that keeps the food coming. Several things are going to have to be replaced but as a small owned and operated business they need our help.

They are looking for help with replacement equipment, an electrician, an inspector, and a plumber. Sub rules restrict me from linking certain sites but please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to help in anyway.

Thing is, I want to make more friends local to the Orlando area and play more TTRPGs.

I’m nonreligious, LGBT+, and super into anime/manga and video games. I love fantasy as a genre and have found myself falling in love with D&D through shows like Critical Role and games like Baldur’s Gate 3 (yes I know not every game is like CR and BG3 lol).

I’ve looked through several posts and haven’t seen any that are recent enough to be relevant, so I figured I’d ask again! Anything in Central Orlando would be best for me as I don’t have a car and can’t make the trek to Altamonte or Waterford Lakes (C&B isn’t as good as it used to be, IMO) but I’m willing to hear any suggestions/recommendations and try to make it work.

Getting to sit at a table with other queer folks would be best case scenario but I’d really like to just get along first and foremost.

Tengoles,Adam Curtis-Can't Get You Out Of My Head (2021) [1:14:16],"Casually ran into this documentary, ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" by Adam Curtis. It's a fascinating deep dive into how history, politics, and culture have shaped the modern world. What makes it so compelling is the style – the entire documentary is made up of archival footage, clips from the eras he explores, and haunting music that gives it a dreamlike, almost hypnotic feel. Curtis weaves together the rise of individualism, the spread of conspiracy theories, and the hidden forces that shape our emotions, creating connections between events you wouldn’t expect. Haven't reached the end but I feel like I have a clear understanding of why the world feels so fragmented today. It’s the kind of documentary that doesn’t just tell you history – it immerses you in it.

I put only the duration of the first episode in the title to avoid scaring people off but the whole thing consists of six episodes totalling 7 hours and 40 minutes. ",2024-12-25 13:23:21,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbPZYrS_g_At_AciykufZokPrN53wyZ0w&si=HbXnkNCoayPb5_Cq,Documentaries,False

RawLife53,"What Pretends to be ""News"" is a Advertising and Marketing Show","Submission Statement:  *Discussion about the advertising and marketing shows that pretends to be News.*

\-----------------

What Pretends to be ""News"" is a Advertising and Marketing Show! Relying on *""Sensationalism as a baited hook"".*

If they are not promoting products, they are promoting books, far too often they use ""*Sensationalist* Headlines  to lure people to be caught up watch a series of advertising commercials.    This is all wrapped from a podium lined with people ""spewing their opinions"" about stuff they don't know a damn things about! But they are trained to embellish anything and everything for drama, while they sit in their make up and costumes, *pretending to be an authority on ""everything"".*   

America was a far better nation when they had just   1 hr of Morning News & 6pm Evening News, those time slots did not have time to embellish and push their opinions and flood people with product sales and advertising commercials.  They had to report the facts, and people could do their own research and develop their own opinions.   

People read ""Newspaper"" and could form their own opinions about reporting that focus on the specific subject they were discussing.   Reporters who had to get direct credible facts before they could print and publish it.

**Not** this TV 90 second, Headline Spin, followed by a bunch of people laughing and smiling, and stone face variations of looks like they are in the middle of  Schizophrenia episode with Tourette syndrome antics, pushing out opinions about things they have not actual facts about.  Followed by entire segments hawking products and books and companies, followed by a litany of commercial advertisements..",2024-12-14 14:43:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/comments/1he4av8/what_pretends_to_be_news_is_a_advertising_and/,media_criticism,False

TristansDad,A man drinks too much at a Christmas party and foolishly decides to drive home.,"He’s more or less holding it together, but when he reaches a large roundabout he gets confused and misses the correct exit. Rather than going around a second time, in his inebriated state, he slams on the brakes, puts the car into reverse and backs up towards his exit.

Suddenly, there’s an almighty crash and the man is thrown back into his seat. He’s reversed into another car! “Oh shit!”

Then the flashing blue lights of a police car appear. “Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.” He realises what he’s done and starts searching for breath mints. Cigarettes. Anything to hide the smell of alcohol. Oh, God! How could he have been so stupid?

In his mirror he sees the cop talk to the driver behind him. The driver is obviously upset, very animated, gesticulating wildly and pointing at the car in front. The cop nods, slowly walks over, leans over to the driver in front and says…

“Damn drunk drivers. They should all be locked away. I’m sorry, sir. The guy who hit you is so wasted he can’t tell where he is or which way he’s going. His speech is slurred and his vision so fucked up he swears that you crashed into him!” 

(Needless to say, drinking and driving is not smart! Have a great Christmas and stay safe). ",2024-12-25 14:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1hm1ma0/a_man_drinks_too_much_at_a_christmas_party_and/,Jokes,False

There is no singular magic diet for everyone on the planet. People have varying dietary needs / goals depending on physical condition, health issues, age, goals, and dietary and activity history.

Avoid *always* scenarios, assumptions, and generalizations. Bashing on others demanding some macro / micro is all bad or all great for every person on the planet is unrealistic and not the way to discuss food nutritive content here.

Lastly and most important, for those seeking advice here about personal diet (and those trying to sneak in health concerns), proper and accurate advice involves;

* testing to establish current values, tracking over time, and impacts from changes
* examination of medical and family history
* examination of dietary history and activity
* an accredited professional, fully and properly educated, keeping up to date with the latest peer reviewed research. This will always be many times over more accurate and safe than resorting to 1) anonymous strangers who most often are not specialists or educated on the topic 2) people who do not have the proper info to advise you for your specific circumstance and 3) the horrid but realistic possibility that anonymous uninformed sources may either unintentionally or, sadly worse, intentionally give harmful advice

Vet comes back in and showed me a picture on her phone, she had apparently googled a similar image to what my cat has and said that this could just be a hypersensitive reaction to plastic/glass bowls. That left me dumbfounded as those are two completely different diagnosis, I guess my point is can vets take a more careful look before giving pet parents a fright fest ",2024-12-25 14:21:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1hm1k0m/vets_misdiagnosing_tumor_and_using_google_on_her/,Pets,False

Significant-Sale4624,What would be the possible right way of decentralisation of government facilities?,"In India ,centralizing major government departments in one city creates multiple problems that impact both urban and rural populations. Rural residents often face high financial and time costs when traveling to the capital for essential services, which can discourage them from accessing what they need. They will also face urban problems such as overcrowding, rising living costs, pollution, social corruption, racism and traffic congestion, which will add additional strain on city infrastructure. Furthermore, centralization can limit economic and social development in smaller towns and rural areas, deepening regional inequalities.

 While decentralization can address these issues by distributing government functions more evenly across regions, it involves significant logistical challenges, high relocation costs, and the potential disruption of established systems. Balancing these considerations is essential for creating a more inclusive and efficient government structure.

vampirstajn,"Is it just me, or is WordPress driving journalists crazy?","Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been working in software for over 6 years now, and most of my clients are from the media industry. After seeing how journalists work (and the headaches they deal with), I keep wondering… why are most content management systems such a mess? 😅

From what I’ve seen, WordPress gets thrown at almost everything – but it’s often slow, insecure, and let’s be honest… not exactly tailored for journalists who just want to focus on their craft.

So, I’m toying with the idea of building a CMS **designed specifically for journalists** – something super simple to use, cheaper to maintain, and crazy reliable (I’m talking 99.9999% uptime). Plus, since I’ve got a lot of experience in data collection/processing, I’d integrate smart reporting features that could actually help with content performance and audience insights.

Would this kind of tool make your life easier? Or are most journalists just resigned to sticking with WordPress and workarounds at this point?

I’m not here to sell anything – just trying to validate if this is even worth pursuing. I’d love to hear your thoughts (or rants 😄).

Would you use something like this? What drives you nuts about current CMS platforms?",2024-12-25 09:13:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1hlxfcr/is_it_just_me_or_is_wordpress_driving_journalists/,Journalism,False
CarelessAstronaut391,"Coming from a creative, nonfiction background and punctuating paraphrasing","Hello, as I am exploring getting my writing published in news magazines and websites, I wonder how or when to tell editors that I am coming from a creative, nonfiction background. Especially, in regards to paraphrasing.

Because the subjects of the following story have poor English, I paraphrased a lot of what they said. I'm used to publishing in literary magazines, but this is a current event piece about Israelis and Palestinians and is being pitched to newsy-type places.

I have a draft of a piece that includes an interview and I put this under the title. 

*Note: throughout the draft of this story I have paraphrased xxx’s and xxx's words in some places and used traditional journalistic editing such as brackets in other places, both for context and clarity.*

At each place they are paraphrased I've been writing: (Subject's name) then ':' or ""says""  and then their paraphrased words without quotes. All the places with quotes are where I use things like brackets and ellipses in my closest approximation of journalistic editing.

Does this all work? Should I change anything?

She used to go sit at parks kind of late to get away from the house, this is when the officers started coming and talking to her, but two would box her in basically. And not long after they started pulling her over. They never give her a reason and it’s always at night. An officer pulled her over and grabbed her purse and dumped it all over the car, made her get out of the car, she has to use a cane to walk by the way, slammed her against the car and “patted” her down in a very fucking groping way. This officer told her he was doing her a favor not arresting her and now she owed him one.

Admirable_Gold5274,Tulsa cops suck ass,"What’s the point of calling the cops when they do nothing. This guy speeds around me and brake checks me when I honk at him. I got his license plate and I know where he lives. We live at the same complex so it’s not like he was even in a hurry. I call the cops and they come talk to me when they get here… just to tell me they can’t do anything about it. Like go talk to the guy. Do something about this reckless driver. Why can’t they tag cars or do something. Like go talk to the guy not me. I don’t understand. Like thanks so much for all your help cops now I know its pointless to call for anything.
 Just a side note: my bf called the cops because someone started getting in his & other’s face  thinking someone took his bike. It was a pretty scary situation for him so he called the cops and they said “what do you want us to do about it exactly” like what!!! Okay thanks he’ll just get stabbed next time. 
Anyways!!!! I want to go stab that guys tired and break his windows fucking prick. I wanna write “skinhead asshole” on the side of his car with spray paint. 
Anything to fuck his day up like he fucked up mine. He almost hit my car and he just gets to walk away. Even if I had a dash cam I feel like they still wouldn’t care but I guess this is the time to get one. 🙄",2024-07-15 10:13:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/copssuckdick/comments/1e3r7ss/tulsa_cops_suck_ass/,copssuckdick,False

SecondAccountYes,"Looking to move to ND; Jobs, Cities, Living Advice ?","Good evening,

  
I am looking to move to North Dakota. I live in Virginia now, but I visited Minot and Fargo, liked the atmosphere, and know people up north in Canada that I'm very close to that I visit from time to time, so it would be nice to be closer. I am close to D.C. in Virginia, so I am paying a premium and higher living costs by living closer to bars, clubs, restaurants, etc, but I don't participate in that life. I also would love a change of pace and scenery in another state.

  
I stay to myself, go to the gym (my hobby being bodybuilding), and work. I am looking to move to ND sooner rather than later, but I just have questions regarding recommended cities, costs of living, and the biggest concern being Jobs.



 I have my B.S. in Statistics with a minor in Bioengineering which I acquired in 2023. Since then, I've worked for half a year as an outreach assistant at a consulting company and then 8 months and counting (still employed) as a Statistician / Statistical Programmer for a federal government agency that doesn't have any buildings outside the East Coast, US. 

  
I have been having issues finding jobs or places to live largely as I don't know where to look besides glassdoor, indeed, and linkedin, and I also don't know the reputations of businesses or areas there. 

  
As for jobs, I'm assuming my options would be titles including ""Analyst"" or ""Data"" in the name but I'm open to anything. I was hoping that I could make a salary of 65-70k a year at least with rent being under 1200 for a 1 bedroom, but I have no clue if this is even feasible. I also don't care if the job is private sector or government. 

  
I would just love recommendations on what areas are safer, apartment complexes, possible company recommendations / job boards, and anything else you think I'd benefit from hearing! In a perfect world, I'd be in North Dakota by April as that's when my lease ends here.",2024-12-25 03:55:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/1hlt7mo/looking_to_move_to_nd_jobs_cities_living_advice/,northdakota,False

CartoonistEmpty4436,Question about vyvanse binge/withdrawal ,"A question about vyvanse binge.

Hello, I used high doses of Vyvanse this week (70 to 210mg) because it wasn’t working. Later, I found out why. I take an antidepressant called Brintellix and also an antipsychotic called Latuda (a D2 antagonist). Due to my past abuse and the medications blocking the effects of stimulants, I developed a significant tolerance in just a few days. I’m not sure if that’s possible.

My question is: even with one week of high-dose use (while eating, sleeping 8 hours, and staying hydrated) and my medications somehow “blocking the effects of stimulants,” will I experience any kind of withdrawal? I only used it for one week.

In my mind, if I’m not feeling the effects, I won’t supose to have a hard withdrawal ,  Am I correct?

Sorry for the bad English. Merry Christmas to all!

SilenceKid17,Comedy Films are Dead?,"Where did the comedy go? Growing up in the 2000s we were treated to such comedy delights as Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Role Models, I Love You, Man, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, Superbad, Tropic Thunder, just to name a few. These were real comedies anchored with real Hollywood budgets. These films had a certain weight to them you just don’t feel in the “comedies” released today.

Comedies today, the few that there are, feel cheap and rushed. Like a plastic action figure, poorly designed and easily broken. I worry about the state of comedy not only in movies but in television, as well as standup. It almost feels like we as a society we don’t know what is funny anymore and I’m not quite sure what happened to us. You can say the pandemic, but it’s much deeper than that.

They don’t even make the comedies like Balls of Fury, Sex Drive, The Rocker, etc. anymore. I don’t remember the last time I laughed in the theater at a movie that was intended to make you laugh. Maybe Deadpool and Wolverine but we can’t replace comedy with the superhero genre. That’s just sad. 

There are no comedy stars anymore. Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Seth Rogen, Zach Galifianakis, and the lot are all aging and no one is replacing them. We thought it might be Pete Davidson but he’s been MIA. Adam DeVine and Kevin Hart is about all we have and neither of them are making memorable, impactful comedies. 

Even SNL isn’t a pipeline for comedy stars anymore. Kate McKinnon hasn’t quite had the post SNL success that her SNL alums have achieved. Beck Bennett is stuck doing B-Dubs commercials. Aidy Bryant isn’t starring in movies like she might have 10-15 years ago. 

Tim Robinson and his circle are about the only ones bringing the funny these days.

Overall, the state of comedy, to me, feels very bleak.

Idk, I don’t want to keep rambling. I just want someone to tell me why comedy has died and how do we bring it back to life?",2024-12-25 11:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/1hlze97/comedy_films_are_dead/,comedy,False

the_evil_potat0,"New here, question","Re watching MaM, are there any legal actions that can be taken against Michael O’Kelley? Who would impose this? Guilty or innocent, this is wrong. Added a summary:

In Making a Murderer, Michael O’Kelly, Brendan Dassey’s former defense investigator, faced significant criticism for his actions during his interactions with Brendan, particularly the moment where he asked Brendan to fill out a form indicating whether he was “sorry” or not. O’Kelly’s behavior raised ethical concerns, as it appeared he was working against his client’s best interest, undermining the defense, and pressuring Brendan into self-incrimination.

However, there is no clear public record of formal disciplinary repercussions or legal action taken specifically against O’Kelly for this behavior. Legal and ethical scrutiny was focused on the defense team as a whole, particularly Len Kachinsky, Brendan’s original defense attorney, who was later removed from the case due to his failure to effectively represent Brendan. O’Kelly’s actions were often viewed as part of Kachinsky’s broader mishandling of the case.

While O’Kelly’s conduct sparked outrage and calls for accountability, any consequences he might have faced (such as damage to his reputation or professional standing) were not prominently covered in the series or in subsequent public discussions.",2024-12-22 18:50:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/1hk4w7j/new_here_question/,MakingaMurderer,False

Landorin32,I just switched from HP Reverb G2 VR to Pico 4 and I'm really glad I did!,"Hey all,

so, for years I had the HP Reverb G2 headset as I was unhappy with the low resolution of my first headset (Rift DK1) which killed the immersion, especially on games such as Elite Dangerous.

The resolution on the G2 is pretty amazing but takes its toll on the hardware. In Elite, at full resolution, max details and FSR on, it was only okay in black space. On a planet and especially inside the starbase on the landing pad it lagged too much: pilot menus opening slower, Escape menu opening significantly slower, the view dragged somewhat behind when turning your head. Pretty much unplayable with such settings! Hence I kept the resolution or lowered it to 50% in Steam. Still it could lag during Thargoid invasions on planets. This was on an RTX 4070 and an i7-8700k, GPU always showed 100% in Windows (CPU was fine).

I know the 4070 is not really a 4k card but I didn't want to spend more 1xxx Euro on a single GPU! I got the RX 7900 XT a few days ago which is supposed to handle 4k. However, I did not notice any improvement in Elite. I looked up a lot of guides, hints, tried out a lot of tweaks but nothing really changed the situation and I kept wondering if mixed reality might be the real cause. Unfortunately, you have to use it with the Reverb.

The other day I got myself the Pico 4 (non-Ultra) after I heard from a friend about it for the first time. My first impression is: wow! Even at 150% resolution, which was way too laggy on the Reverb, I do not notice any lag on the mentioned scenes above. It runs quite smooth and totally playable! And that is via WiFi (6) AND FSR off (setting is set to ""normal"")! If at all I would say the view on the Reverb was a tiny bit more crystal clear but this might be related that I used the WiFi connection instead of USB. Still, the difference is minimal. Okay, this was just one game so far but I already like the wireless setup! And the access point is not even in the same room (gladly the Pico 4 also supports H.265). Software wise all I use is Pico's streaming assistant (for wired-only headset users: this is mandatory even if you play via USB) and Steam VR.

What is also a nice improvement is the augmented reality and its transition. The Reverb shows your real surrounding in black and white only and very very blurry. The Pico 4 shows it in color, still blurry but much much better: it might be hard reading something on your actual monitor but you can easily identify everything else in your real surrounding. For the transition: if you leave your marked virtual environment boundaries the Pico will switch automatically to real environment view and vice versa when you step back in. You could technically play in your chair, walk to the bathroom and brush your teeth with the headset on. ;) Also, the headset feels somewhat lighter. Yet the comfort on the Reverb was better (the back pad feels a little stiff and incovenient on the Pico). The only other thing I noticed is the standard face piece lets in more light on each side that reflects on the lenses. Yet I figure there might be 3rd party ones that can do better perhaps.

Given the fact the price is also lower here for the Pico 4 I am really glad I made this switch, having the wireless capability, the better real environment view and especially better performance. Whether this was actually caused by Windows Mixed Reality or the Reverb, who knows. I will put back in my Geforce 4070 soon and give that a go. Chances are I might perhaps not even need the RX 7900 XT, we will see.

I'd be curious if there are other people that switched from the G2 to other headsets than the Pico that offer the same resolution and whether they also noticed a performance increase.

P.S.: after years of owning the Reverb G2 as well as 2 monitors connected I found something out just recently: sometimes Windows Mixed Reality claims the headset is not on or connected even though it was. Turned out if my second monitor was simply turned off because I had no need for it I got exactly that error! Once I turned on the second monitor the error vanished (cannot remember if I had to restart WMR for that).",2024-12-25 14:36:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hm1sqb/i_just_switched_from_hp_reverb_g2_vr_to_pico_4/,virtualreality,False

germs120,Who would you like to see in the 2025 Royal Rumble as a surprise?,For me - Dolph Ziggler. I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch with the partnership WWE has had with TNA as of late…but I can’t see him being back for a long term.

RobinAndBeastboy,"So, Netflix won't have all archival content from the Network (UK)?","So there's speculation & more affirmation through wider channels that WWE Network definitely won't have all of the archival footage. Last time I raised my concerns I was rage jumped by a bunch of looney fans disapproving over the concept that it'll all be on Netflix (UK audience- we don't have Peacock) because they didn't want to face that it could be probable. Well, now as time edges to this dysfunction of the app it feels more real. (See the source)

So what exactly are they going to do with all the archived footage they spent years reediting for our viewership? They know as well as the entire wrestling fanbase that was the primary selling point. I'm lost.... why are they doing this to us? I haven't even finished all the old WCW shows.

Fizzy_onReddit,AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for calling her friend “bae” ?,"So I (12 M) was on FaceTime with my girlfriend (12 F) like I usually always am and my friend texts me, we’ll call him jimmy btw all of this takes place on Snapchat. So he posted something on his story saying “happy 3 month anniversary” to his gf we’ll call her Kim and I responded to it and said “y’all have not been dating for 3 months” because as far I was concerned they started dating after me and my girlfriend (we’ve been dating for 2 months) but he revealed to me that they had been dating a week before us basically so basically he was cheating on the girl he was with at the time we’ll call her dotty. So I told my girlfriend ( more like read it out loud) so she tells dotty because they’re friends n stuff and she gets upset or whatever. Anyway back to the relevancy, she’s comforting her friend and she says something like “it’s okay bae.” which annoys me a bit so I jokingly call her “gay” and a cheater n stuff she says “no I love you” so I say “not exclusively” so this is where it escalates. I say “it’s ok gay bae” she responds with “ew please stop” and I also said “just don’t call me that rotten shi” to which she responds what is “ I say the name” “ I would rather you just call me by my name” and she says “whatever bro you’re pissing me off” “I’ll just call you “my name” then damn” “just tryna be nice to her” “but can’t do that” and I said “you don’t have to call someone bae to be nice but ok” but I deleted it so AITA for being a little angry at this?",2023-06-14 04:27:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/jealousobamas/comments/148ydv3/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_girlfriend_for/,jealousobamas,False

Beautiful_Day7997,Israel's fragile democratic system,"Given the structure of Israel's political system and operation of Israel's checks and balances and it's fragility, I think it would better to do one of the 3 following options in order to maintain a certain amount of stability within the country:

1. Establish a senate, much like in the Roman system, where you'd have a senator, typically an experienced statesman/expert in both local and international politics/ lawyer/ political analyst, etc, elected via local elections. Each senator will be a representative from a certain district/city while being required to serve the interests of all citizens and people who live in the country. Since the Knesset is the parliament, which in most democracies serves as the lower house of the legislative branch, a senate has much less members but serves as the higher house of the legislative branch and therefore has direct oversight over any undemocratic legislation of laws which the parliament will try to pass. So in hindsight, such powers which are currently in the hands of the supreme court and the judicial branch, should be handed over to the Senate (if one is established) in order to balance things out and maintain a prolonged political stability in the country.

2. Replace the current democratic system with a dynamic democracy, which's sort of a mix of a direct democracy and a representative democracy.

3. Maintain a limited government by closing unnecessary ministries and jobs within the legislative branch as whole.

In europe, p2p markets have collapsed due to regulatory pressure which will even worsen due to their latest attack (mica).

It is nearly impossible to buy it with cash outside of dodgy internet ads (99% are scammers, and priced above 15-25% of market prices).

Ok-Poem7671,My neighbor is going to put private pictures on the internet I think i even have a date 2024-01-02 ,"Hello everyone.

I am almost 100% sure my neighbor is going to put private pictures of me maybe videos of me online to make me take my life or something he knows im an unstable person. The sick thing i have known this person since i was 15 he moving in next to me is the shittiest thing. To start everything of one night i was having a smoke on my balcony his bedroom is littlarly next to my balcony to the left. His apartment is on my floor he owns both doors on my floor. so its my door and his 2. He lives with his father and sister about same age as me. So whatever i was sitting having a smoke on my balcony then i see him and 2 other people taking pictures of me with flash so i can see. And then saying something in the lines of this is the face you make when something. OFC i was mad i typed to him to snapchat that im going to beat him up if he dont answer and talk to me. Ofc no answer so i was just waiting for him to walk out the door so i could catch him. this resulted my mother who i live with to get worried so she made me not looking out the door. This later resulted in me going in to hospital because she did not believe me at all. When i asked my neigbhour again he said that i was seing things ????. Was there for maybe 1 week in the hospital. I accepted the fact that maybe they was right and things was normal for a while. Some time after i was having a smoke again they did the same thing. This time i did not react and heard them saying why is he not getting mad ?

i just tought to not give them reaction and maybe it will stop. It did for some time. Stupid of me there was one time he wrote to me asking to come over and chill. Dont know why i trusted him then but he came over and we chilled. Everthing seemed fine. Then we had a smoke and he said he was going to get some pappers to roll one with. He then locked me out on my balcony with his friend and was gone for over 1 hour during this time when i now have overthinked everthing i know he has put some kind of listening device or camera in my home i know. Because people are acting weird with me and people blocking me out of nowhere. He also does this only when im alone my mom leaves for one week evey other week. when im sitting in my livingroom his bedroom is wall to wall and i can hear what he says sometimes. And heard them talking about me saying stuff like disqusting hhuu?  ofc i get very sad and cried and had very dark toughts. Im guesssing he has videos of me masturbating or something. I can hear them standing on their balcony saying my name and dont goo to sleep to me. I just dont know what do to im thinking of going to the police this week before he does something so its on paper. The thing is that i think everyone is in on it to because they think its funny. I hate my life. I know when this happens it will not be forever but it will make me go more in to deppresion. Please help me what should i do im completetly alone in this. Dont know if this is right to post this here or anything maybe will remove soon just want some feedback Kind Regards",2024-12-25 13:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1hm16h6/my_neighbor_is_going_to_put_private_pictures_on/,privacy,False

PeaSame4326,CMV: People telling you to see obese people as people is not promoting obesity,"I am sick and fucking tired of the thinkpieces I see in here! The body positivity movement was created to tell overweight people that they should not hate themselves. If they wanted to promote obesity, they would only spread excessive mukbang content, but that clearly isn't the case. To say fat people are human and deserve to be treated with basic fucking respect is not a radical thought. Some of the most unhealthy eaters I know with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, pre diabetes, GERD, and perspiration issues are skinnier than me or socially acceptable. I know a woman whose who diet is Cheetos and mac and cheese. Girl is so backed up and constipated, she literally poops once a week and it is one giant hard log. Yet when we are next to each other, people unsolicitedly compare our bodies. 

Most fat people you'll meet are on a weight loss journey and I wish people were kinder. No wonder there was a body positivity movement. People are so freaking mean to fat people for existing! How do folks have an issue with other people's weight, idk. 

Unless you are a doctor or trainer, you shouldn't have anything to say about anyone's weight. Also, fat people deserve to smile and not have to deal with people being assholes. And if other people are being assholes, fat people have a right to ignore them and smile anyway.


Lil Segway below:


Sadly, I reached this conclusion when I became overweight. I was on meds and had deep depression so I ballooned from a solid 160 to 200 in the span of 4 to 5 years. To see the treatment I am receiving is jarring. I went from eating what I want to people micromanaging my food intake. I'll never forget when I got over a weight plateau and celebrated (lost 10 lbs) only for someone to come in and call me fat within hours and how I need to lose weight. Then for me to finally fit in a dress that I couldn't wear for over a year and still be told, ""You need to stop eating so much, you need to start exercising."" The ironic thing is that I was, which is why I could fit in more clothes lmfao. 

I've actively been eating less and spacing out my meals. My one dinner has become dinner for night one and night two. My breakfast has been spread out where half is breakfast and the other half is lunch. I do struggle with eating late because tbh I never finish my meals throughout the day, yet because I have a belly, I'm dragged for it. Plus it made me realize that people don't know what weight looks like. I've weighed myself before family dinners and I am the same exact weight as when I saw them months ago. Yet I walk in the door and people are yelling at me that I got fatter and need to stop eating. I'm glad the body positivity movement exists because I'm not going to let people make me feel like shit for being overweight right now, but I'm just tired.

jeanzzzzz6,Where to move that will stay snowy for the coming decades?,"Hello all. As Christmas creeps up, I’m left thinking about how, in my home state of West Virginia, we’ve only had two “snows” so far this year, neither of which stuck for more than a few hours, and how it’s projected to be almost 70 degrees later this week- at the end of December. I’m only 21, I’ve felt this trend escalating for my entire life. I can remember getting my 12th birthday off of school due to snow, in late October. It hasn’t snowed here before the middle of December in years, and we’ve averaged MAYBE one decent snow a year as of late. Cold, snowy weather is my absolutely favorite thing. 

I want to start a large family and settle down somewhere that is very, very cold and snowy, and will remain that way even as climate change takes its toll over the coming decades. Somewhere with snowpack into the spring. Does that/will that exist in the continental U.S. anymore? In 2050, will there be ANY parts of the country that get genuine blizzards? Is elevation the key? This question plagues my mind as I’ve always imagined raising my kids somewhere that you can sled and play in the snow for several months out of the year, where you have to bundle up to go outside, and where Christmas is white. 

So… where? Thanks a bunch, I hope you’re all well. Merry Christmas",2024-12-24 20:34:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hllxpy/where_to_move_that_will_stay_snowy_for_the_coming/,climatechange,False

Hello GoT lovers. I just started a [Realm of Thrones](https://youtu.be/M5G5pmzRHIg?si=x3mxQmyuTZpletGr) playthrough on Mount and Blade II Bannerlord.

Even if you don't know much about Mount and Blade 2, it is pretty easy to figure out. Also, this is the kind of video that is perfect for running in the background as you game. You don't need to pay 100% attention to it and you will still be able to follow along easily. Any and all support is appreciated.

So we were strongly advised to avoid projects with the possibility to receive 1000% per annum or more, and pay attention to those who offer real figures.

zuess05,Introducing a No-Code Chrome Extension Builder – Looking for Feedback and Insights!,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on an idea for a SaaS tool that I believe could make Chrome extension development much simpler, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

The Idea:

A no-code Chrome extension builder where users can: 

1.	Input a simple prompt, describing what they want the extension to do.  
2.	The system generates a zip folder with all the necessary files for the extension.   
3.	Users can then give follow-up prompts to make changes, and the updated files are generated instantly.

Who It’s For: 

•	Non-developers who want to create simple extensions.   
•	Developers who want to save time on repetitive or boilerplate tasks.   
•	Freelancers and small businesses needing custom solutions without hiring a developer.

Why I’m Here:

I’m in the early stages of development and wanted to get feedback from the awesome community here:   
1.	What challenges do you face when developing Chrome extensions?  
 2.	Would a tool like this be useful to you? Why or why not?   
3.	Are there features or capabilities you’d love to see in such a tool?   
4.	What are the biggest pain points in complying with Chrome Web Store policies?

I’d really appreciate your insights, especially since this is a community of developers and enthusiasts who know the space better than most. The goal is to make Chrome extension development faster, more accessible, and less frustrating for everyone.

Let me know your thoughts or feel free to ask questions!",2024-12-25 13:26:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome_extensions/comments/1hm0p0e/introducing_a_nocode_chrome_extension_builder/,chrome_extensions,False

Purple-Wear-6153,Why Can’t I Seek Compensation for Harmful NICU Treatment in the 80s?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking advice on why it seems impossible to get compensation for negligence and malpractice in the NICU treatment I received in the 80s at a small, under-resourced hospital. I was born with fetal distress, and instead of performing a c-section or induction, my distress was prolonged, and I was subjected to outdated treatments, including high-dose gentamicin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. While these treatments were lifesaving, they caused significant long-term health issues:

-Permanent severe hearing loss

-A severe case of Crohn's disease, which has impacted me throughout my life

-Chronic respiratory issues, likely stemming from the meconium aspiration and how it was handled


Despite the known risks of these outdated practices, I’ve been told there’s little to no legal recourse. I’m trying to understand why:

1. Is it due to the statute of limitations?


2. Were standards for proving medical negligence lower or different in the 80s?


3. Are these complications dismissed as “acceptable risks” of NICU care at the time?



It feels deeply unfair that the long-term harm caused by practices—considered outdated today—is treated as an unavoidable trade-off for survival.

Has anyone dealt with similar situations or have insights into legal or advocacy options for cases like this? Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",2024-12-25 13:59:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1hm17fv/why_cant_i_seek_compensation_for_harmful_nicu/,healthcare,False

Have a wonderful holiday.

Ok_Woodpecker_7158,The story of vigilante delivery guy / santa claus,"I was asked to share the story of why I was thankful for vigilante delivery guy, so here you go.... (Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/s/PJYvAcWznf )

In a far away land some guy made of candycanes bought sneakers online as a christmas gift for his brother. But the shipment was delayed, and the company said there were issues... He was so scared it wouldn't be here for Christmas bro.

Eventually, he got an email saying ""we've refunded your order."" He panicked-- Sure enough, the website says it was automatically returned and refunded because of a shipping problem. Oh no oh no Christmas is ruined...

Well that night, he gets home, and there's a box on the doorstep. He checks the recordings on his cameras, and some guy -- literally just some guy, in some casual car, some casual clothes -- drops off the box and leaves. 

Candycane man checks the box... it's not a bomb! And there the sneakers are. Meanwhile, he has been fully refunded! (They were expensive lmao)

Candycane man is forever grateful. He would of course pay for the shoes if requested by the fictional shoe company. But the shoes came on time for Christmas, and that's what matters.

Was the mystery man Santa Claus? Or the vigilante of FedEx? We may never know.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning! Merry Christmas and happy holidays!",2024-12-25 07:25:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/1hlw3g9/the_story_of_vigilante_delivery_guy_santa_claus/,Calgary,False

JakeFromSkateFarm,A&W Mexi-Burger??,"Completely random question, but I’m hoping older Redditors or others with older parents might help. 

TL;DR - does anyone know of A&W selling “Mexican” burgers in or around Fremont in the late 60s?

My parents are in their 70s and from Fremont, and are adamant that A&W in the 60s/70s sold some sort of loose meat burger that they call a “mexi burger”. They describe it as loose meat but without a sauce like a sloppy joe. They seem to think it was seasoned similar to taco meat. 

The issue is that I can find zero reference to this online. No mention or memory by anyone about a mexi burger, Mexican burger, taco burger, etc. Even photos of vintage A&W menus from the 60s and 70s (or other decades) has no mention of this burger. 

The closest I can find are menu references to chili burgers and a “bar-b-que” burger, but no pics of those and they’re sure it wasn’t either of those. 

Other than just being mythical or them misremembering another restaurant (they’re convinced they had it with root beer), the only other thing I can think of is that this was some sort of local franchisee addition that was on (some) Nebraska location menus but wasn’t nationwide, hence nobody else remembering it on vintage food forums and such.  

I’ve heard them occasionally refer to this burger as being their favorite and how much they wish A&W would bring it back, so I always assumed it was a national thing they’d enjoyed until the 80s around the US as a military family. But I just learned they only ever had it at the Fremont A&W, which would lend credence to it either being a franchisee option or confusion with another Fremont burger place (assuming it’s not the bbq or chili burgers). 

Thanks in advance for any help. ",2024-12-25 03:08:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nebraska/comments/1hlsjar/aw_mexiburger/,Nebraska,False

revanon,It's Christmas Eve and I'm an ordained pastor + hospital chaplain. AMA.,"Christmastime is here, happiness and cheer! (Or so Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang tell me.) Time for my annual reddit AMA—I’ve been doing these for a long time now and I always enjoy them. I’m an ordained pastor and endorsed chaplain in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a small American Protestant denomination. After nearly thirteen years in church ministry, I switched over to chaplaincy, and for the past two years I’ve served a hospital primarily in the emergency room and an ICU. In all that time in ministry I’ve seen a lot and learned a lot. I just handed off to one of my colleagues for the next shift and I’ll be here to answer your questions for the next few hours. (With no hitting up for nickels like Lucy does to Charlie Brown!)

My two usual disclaimers: I do these AMAs solely in my personal capacity; I am not a spokespastor for my employer or denomination. And I will not answer a question in such a way that would require betraying the confidences of the people to whom I minister.

ShirubaMasuta,My brother wants his kitten he brought along to be more alone when visiting ,"So my brother is visiting for Christmas and he brought his new kitten along. She's almost 5 months old. 

My dad and step mom had several cats over the years. Got 1 and 2 from my uncle, 2 died cause he got bit terribly, got 3, got 4, got 5, gave 4 away, 5 died cause of a car, got 6, got 7. This is over 10 years. They have experience.

He's been here for 3 days now. Today we were all watching a movie, and my step mom starts talking to my brother. She said it's important to remember to pet the kitten. She picks the kitten up while we were watching a movie and starts petting her.


I don't remember exactly what she said but she said it was important cause she's going to be an outdoor cat cause my brother said the kitten was gonna go outdoors eventually. She made a comment about him not knowing much about cats.

We're sharing the same room on the highest floor so when he came up to me when I was going to bed he said that he was gonna keep the kitten up in the room with the door locked on occasion. He says the kitten was being petted against her will. He said to keep this a secret or else it would turn into drama and he would have to leave.

Stenlies,"Крах криптоимперии, люди спасаются бегством","О том, что ситуация вокруг битокина нестабильна не раз утверждали пользователи и эксперты. Однако в том, что любое неловкое движение в сторону биткоина может пошатнуть его курс, многие убедились буквально на днях. После заявления создателя Bitcoin.com Эмиля Ольденбурга о том, что вложение в криптовалюту очень опасно и ненадежно, многие решили продать накопленные монеты, пока курс не рухнул вниз. Это и стало причиной обвала. Всего одно заявление уронило курс биткоина на 15%, попробуйте представить, что может с ним случиться, если повториться опыт с Китаем? 
Многие пользователи, с целью спасти собственные вложения и нервы выводят инвестиции из крипты и вкладываются в майнинговые проекты. При этом необходимо убедиться в том, что ты инвестируешь не в scam-проект. Для проверки существует несколько способов, но иногда достаточно просто систематически изучить проект, чтобы понять, что он действительно перспективный и стоящий. Болгарский проект MiningNow в представлении не нуждается. Он находится в центре внимания начиная с декабря, после того, как Российский алюминий заявил о том, что он и MNW теперь стратегические партнеры и будут совместно работать на создание Центра обработки данных на северо-западе России. 
Многие пользователи, не только Запада, но и России, и стран СНГ инвестировали в MNW, так как за те 7 месяцев существования он сумел зарекомендовать себя как надежный и удобный блокчейн-проект. Европейская компания AA!LAB отлично продумала свой продукт, об этом не единожды писали специалисты и инвесторы, вложившиеся в MiningNow. Недавно стало известно, что организация успешно прошла верификацию. Для пользователей также стартовал конкурс, на привлечение своих знакомых к проекту. Победитель может получить 50 токенов MNW, которые стабильно растут, согласно плану, представленному на официальном сайте.
Сейчас, когда сторонники биткоина действительно начали сомневаться в своей правоте, люди начинают спасаться бегством, тем самым понижая спрос на криптовалюту и обваливая его курс. Инвесторы стоят на пороге очень важного решения: рискнуть и оставить вложение в биткоинах, или продать его и вложиться во что-то более стабильное.

Mother-Back3099,Why do LGBTQ+ people feel like they need to be represented in everything they do?," I feel like over the past few years I've seen more and more instances where LGBT people are asking for representation in things that other groups don't really have or ask for representation in, for example wanting LGBT cosmetics in video games. Can't they just be a part of a something without trying to subdivide it into ""people who are doing *x*"" and ""people who are doing *x*, *and are also LGBT""?*  


Do they realize that when they ask for stuff like that that they're also painting a huge target on their backs, especially in video games? Lately in the Helldivers 2 community, there has been a lot of aggressive back and forth between people who want LGBT cosmetics (capes, armor) and people who don't. Do they not understand that they're setting themselves up to be teamkilled and kicked from matches simply for wearing those cosmetics? Is that what they want? To be represented so they can get teamkilled/kicked so they can cry out that they're being oppressed? It's starting to feel to me that they want representation just so other people will discriminate against them so they can play the victim card for attention.

Why can't they just play the game or belong to a community? Why do they need to tell other people what their sexual preferences are? Why is it so paramount to them to be able to tell people ""Hey, I'm gay/trans/pansexual/etc.! Look at me!"" Why can't we all just be a part of something, but keep all those extra special details about our lives to ourselves?",2024-04-10 11:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsNotASafeSpace/comments/1c0js4d/why_do_lgbtq_people_feel_like_they_need_to_be/,ThisIsNotASafeSpace,False

tkaczyk1991,Goblet of Fire - why didn’t the Death Eaters simply kidnap Harry?,"The plan to kidnap the real mad eye moody, then infiltrate Hogwarts and guide Harry through the (extremely dangerous and potentially fatal) Tri Wizard Tournament seems very elaborate and was clearly in swing before the school year began. 

For example in the movie, “Mad Eye” is shown leading Neville to discuss the book about plants before the first task has even begun. This implies that he knows what the second task is before the tournament has begun - which shows how well they’ve planned this. 

Would it not be more efficient to simply kidnap Harry and take him to Voldemort to take his blood? This would avoid any potential loss of Harry’s life during the tournament, be much quicker to bring Voldemort back, and much simpler to execute rather than spending about a year in planning and executing the very elaborate plan to lead Harry to the port key at the end of the maze.

Here's the Email I've sent him and people close to him:

Subject: Quick message to David Warrington regarding interstate CCW reciprocity

Text:

Sir,

Right now there are bills in play to force CCW reciprocity among the states.  It will cost President Trump time, effort and political capitol to deal with that, as he's promised to do.

Mr. Warrington, it's not necessary.  CCW reciprocity exists now, cooked into NYSRPA v Bruen 2022, and apparently nobody noticed.

As I'm sure you're aware, Bruen footnote 9 puts limitations on states, defining what they can do under the shall-issue carry permit systems allowed under Bruen.  Bruen also specifies carry as a basic civil right.  The limitations are: 

* No subjective standards. 

* No excessive delays for carry access. 

* No exorbitant fees.

I'm now a long haul trucker based in Alabama, with an AL carry permit.  In order to get national carry rights I would need 18 permits total just for the lower 48 states plus DC.  Add in Hawaii and overseas territories, it's over 21 permits.

Most of those permits scattered from California to Massachusetts need their own training program.  Average cost is over $500 with training, some running less, some far more.  With two trips to each jurisdiction for fingerprints and training, total costs will blast through $20,000 and the project would take years.  This is true even before you add in Hawaii, Guam, Virgin Islands...

This utterly detonates the Bruen footnote 9 limitations.  If no one state or territory can do excessive delays or exorbitant fees, neither can a coalition of more than 20.

If anybody thinks footnote 9 is dicta, they might even be right, but it doesn't matter.  Carry as a basic civil right is NOT dicta in Bruen and once that was established, then of course the states and territories cannot arrange excessive delays or exorbitant fees.  Bruen footnote 9 is just Thomas being extra clear.  Even if it wasn't there, the core concept remains valid.

All you have to do is sell this idea to whoever fills the US AG slot.  He or she can immediately use the DOJ Civil Rights Division to enforce Bruen against the states. 

At that point the states can come up with an interstate gun packer's compact modeled after the interstate compact that allows us to drive in the entire US without new driver's licenses or vehicle registration documents for each state, a problem first solved sometime prior to WW2 for the driving privilege, let alone a right.  They can probably use the compact to require us to score one permit in any state with a 16hr training program to be good to go nationally, and get away with that under Bruen.

What's going on now is radically unconstitutional and the DOJ can literally put an end to it ""on day one"" of Trump's administration with no new legislation or court action needed.  If the new AG isn't ready Trump can directly order the DOJ Civil Rights Division to take control of this fiasco affecting, among others, roughly 3mil truckers :).

The US Supreme Court has already spoken on this matter.  We have reciprocity.  We just need to enforce it.

President Trump is good at that.

AppropriateGiraffes3,I need resources for a friend in Colorado ❤️,"Other possible TWs:
Controlling parents.
Physical restrictions (unable to leave home without permission).
Restricting her ability to get a job (hence why I tagged financial abuse).

She has not mentioned anything about emotional or physical abuse, however I get the feeling she feels scared. 

To the situation (I apologise for how brief this is, I am trying to avoid being specific about her because I am unsure if she has reddit or any family members on reddit). I'm Australian, but have a friend (F, between the age of 19-22) in Colorado, US, whose parents are extremely controlling. She has stated that they have restricted her ability to get her driver's licence, a job, download apps on her phone and other (in my opinion) extreme parental controls. (Note: she does not have any disabilities that warrant this level of parental control over her life). She also has pets that are totally her responsibility (she treats them well and adores them) which I believe she will want to take with her if she leaves. She has stated that she wishes for more freedom and would like minimal contact with her parents.

My questions are:
What are some resources I can suggest to her to help her?
Myself and another friend (who is also American) are gathering information and resources before we speak to her after the holidays, how should we approach the topic with her?

Thank you x",2024-12-25 13:59:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hm175j/i_need_resources_for_a_friend_in_colorado/,domesticviolence,False

QueenDianaSpencer,Found a black nightgown in husband’s laundry pile???,"
My husband is living in an apartment with 2 guys but he only has been there for an entire month. 

I’m currently in a shelter with our daughter who’s 11 months old and I’m also 8 months pregnant with our other daughter. The reason why we are living like this is SUUPER long and dramatic, but basically he had a mental breakdown and got us evicted and lost his job and they are keeping him away from staying with me at the shelter so he is living at his friend’s pad 

Anyway yesterday I found a silky short black nightgown with skimpy straps and it’s in his laundry pile. I never seen him mix his laundry with theirs for the entire time I’ve visited. Plus they’re Muslim and I don’t reckon they have girlfriends 

When I used to visit early this month he’d give the apartment access code, obviously I never show uninvited it’s only when my Uber arrives there and it’s snowing out and he’s busy to open the door in time.  Now the last 6 times I visited with our daughter, he stopped giving me the access code anytime I asked (I didn’t choose to remember it) and he kinda gives me an attitude when I ask 

Now every time I try to talk about anything or have conversations he always tells me to shut up, which is kinda extreme. He would constantly shut me up if I got too excited or riled up about anything but now anytime i try to talk he’s always like “please, I didn’t bring you to talk” or “Please. Stop talking. I’m not trying to use my brain right now.” Or “Great! Bye!” Or “are you done?” Not even in my first sentence. Or “shut up, I’m tired.” So now part of me is thinking maybe he convinced his 2 roommates that we aren’t together and doesn’t want them to hear us talking ? I never see them bc they’re always in their rooms 


And also whenever I try to ask for a kiss or hug he face is empty like stone and he refuses to. And when I say I love you he says “ok. We’re on a break” but then other times I ask if he loves me and he’s like “of course but just how I love my mom or my family”

When I stay too long he often threatens to call the police and sometimes he rushes me and our daughter home way before the promised period of time we were to spend together. Even tho he knows the shelter is like a prison to us. And if I decide to stay longer he threatens to call 911 and he actually has done so, a week ago. They forced me to go back to the shelter with our baby. 

When I politely questioned him about  if his Muslim roommates and girlfriends he first said “no” and then “it’s none of your business.” Then I politely showed him the nightgown and asked who this belongs to, he said inviting me is always a shit show angrily and said not to ask any further questions or he will call 911 at me again and to leave. Then I asked if any of his roommates had girlfriends  again and he said “yeah I think one of them does” but I didn’t buy it. So I took the nightgown and stashed it in my bag. I thought he’d ask me to return it to his roommate but he didn’t so it made me even more suspicious.  Then he said something like “it’s not like we’re a couple” and then I started crying and said “now I know why you’re so mean to me” and he said “nah if I was cheating I’d be the opposite and be nicer. That’s just how it works”

So yeah I don’t know what to do anymore 
I wish I knew who the nightgown belonged to but I don’t speak to any of his roommates.nor am I allowed to. 

Also I recall on one incident that I bumped into one of his roommates and he gave me the ugliest dirtiest coldest stare it actually terrified me, now it makes me think “what if he knows something I don’t?”",2024-12-25 14:18:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/1hm1i5w/found_a_black_nightgown_in_husbands_laundry_pile/,Hijabis,False

Changelling,"Syrian/israli war after the fall of assad, foretold by a dream interpretation in 2013","Same disclaimer as my last post about dreams: Not everybody believes in dream interpretations (تفسير أحلام) but we Muslims do.

The following is a dream that was shared in a muslim forum called Al-mu'minun wal mu'minat in January 2013, and was interpreted by one of the trusted interpreters there. I will try to translate both the dream + the interpretation to the best of my abilities.

The original poster says:

""Al-Salaam Aleikum. This is a dream that my friend told me about today. My friend is a devout and pious muslim, and this is what he said:  
I was walking in a sandy road in an unrecognizable area, when suddenly 3 riders (on horses), each carrying a sword appeared on the way. When they reached me they greeted me with an Islamic greeting (Al-Salaam Aleikum) and I replied to them.  
They asked me where I was going, so I told them ""to there"" without pointing in any direction, and we walked together. While walking we came across a river, and on the other side we saw a group of jews carrying swords and shields. That's when the 3 riders told me ""we have to fight them"" and so we began discussing this matter, until we reached the conclusion that we must cross this river between us. Suddenly one of the 3 riders rode with his horse and made an impossible jump across the river, reaching the other side. I was amazed by that feat, and so I asked the other 2 riders ""Who is that?"" to which they said ""You don't recognize him?"" I said ""no"", so they said that's the prophet Muhammed peace be upon him""  
End of dream""

The interpreter speaks now:

""This vision brings good news about 2 things. The 1st is the fall of assad and the end of his reign, and the 2nd is the salvation of the Syrian people after assad's fall. This is symbolized by the crossing of the river, and the fact that it was the Prophet Muhammed peace be upon him who crossed the river, means that these are the people whom the prophet has told about in the famous hadith:

A group of people from my Umma will continue to obey Allah's Command, and those who desert or oppose them shall not be able to do them any harm. They will be dominating the people until Allah's Command is executed.  
Sahih Muslim 1037c(Book 33, Hadith 250)

Another detail about what happens after the fall of assad is that the goal in the next phase will be unclear. This is symbolized by the man replying with ""to there"" without pointing in any direction when he was asked where he was going, and it is in this unclear phase, that the zionists will start attacking Syria. This is symbolized by the men seeing a group of jews already wielding swords and prepared for battle, and only afterwards did the riders say ""we have to fight them"". Meaning that zionists will attack Syria, forcing it into a defensive war.  
God knows best""

The part above is a translation of the Arabic text written by the poster of the dream and the interpreter. It's interesting to note that all this was shared on January 31, 2013, and it foretells an israeli attack on Syrian ground after the end of assad's regime.",2024-12-25 14:29:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syria/comments/1hm1osh/syrianisrali_war_after_the_fall_of_assad_foretold/,Syria,False

Farterofone,MIL and wife too controling.,"Hi dads,

So my wife and myself just had a little boy 3 months back. We were trying for a while so we were delighted to finaly have him with us. After 12h of labour and a c-section we got to see our little guy. In the hospital she was so tired that she was happy for me to do everything around him and I was happy too. I grew up with very involved parents and I want to be the same. After we came back from the hospital she was still tired I guess and she looked for help and guidince from me which I was happy to give. 

Her mom was due to come over to help in few days at this point (we live across Europe from her) and her dad was already living with us, she was coming over for 3 months. She is an old school houswife which thinks she knows everything, she gets her facts from Facebook, believes in everything but scientific research and loves controling everything and everyone and trives during conflict and her dad is the best guy ever so I'll leave him out of this rant. Since she came into the house there has been nothing but trouble but since she helpes with cooking and cleaning everyone seems to be content except for me. My wife always feels sorry for her (her moms dad was very abusive during childhood and thats her excuse for everything) even though she so obviously behaves like a controling lunatic. Just for an example and mind you there is about a 100000 of these, when I was buying a new fridge, for my house and my family she for some reasen didn't like my choice and voiced it which is somewhat fine but then after I said that my wife and I love that fridge and I'm going to get it anywhey she started campaigning with her dad, her and her brother to get them to change my mind, only when no one budged she kind of backed off but was still unhappy. She constantly nags everyone about everything which is too much on top of the new baby sleep deprivity and stress. I argued with her a few times and had a few deep talks and things changed but only in front of me, now she goes behind my back to get what she wants and all with an explaination that "" she has a right to her oppinion and she be here as long as she want since her husband lives here"", he is a very nice but passive guy so he wont argue with her. So the point of all this is that all of that nagging is rubbing off of my wife and we went from a very good communtication for 4 years to a fairly degraded one where whatever I do with the baby especially is being micromanaged. 

We have these nights off where me or her can go to the guest room and get some rest for the night while the other one takes over, I think they are very important for us to keep us sane. Whenever it's my turn she comes in and just sits ,wrecked tired, and watches and comments on everything, I try to get her to go back to sleep, but she won't, she says that ""she has a right to be here since thats her baby"". I don't know whats with this family and their rights, but I genuenly don't want to take them away, I want her to get some rest and her to trust me, I got really frustrated tonight and said fuck it if you don't want to leave you handle him and went to ""sleep"". She was talking to him which she got from the mom as well the little passive agressive remarks "" Your dad doesn't care about you"" and then she said I need to go get some help. I have panic attacks as well but I'm not sure if I should go into that now, I manage them good enough she doesn't even know about them most of the time but when she does she acts like I'm a chore. Usually we really have a good relationship but lately with everything it just got so frustrating. I'm sure there is a lot more stuff to be said but this is enought to get a picture. What can I do?

My thing is is that, I want to retain the variability in the large cohorts while more heavily weighing the smaller ones who are equally significant to this. What approach can I use? Should I just do the classical weighing or is there a more refined technique?

The whole thing was drenched in the oil and glue.. Even chunks of it mineralized together in a big crystal. I got all of it out of the globe. 
Most of the glue is melted and was very nasty and all over the battery part which is why I’ve disconnected it. I cleaned it off and maybe after some time of being dry I’ll solder the wires back and pop some batteries in. 

I’m going to try to figure out how to pop her back on the rotating part so she can still be a shelf piece without the water/oil part in there.

rain21199,Safe Storage Question,"I'm looking for safe ways to store my firearms without spending tons of money on a massive safe. 

I'm curious if it would still be effective to buy a smaller safe and simply store the bolts for my rifles instead of the whole thing.

Would there be any downsides to doing that or additional safety concerns?",2024-12-25 14:08:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/1hm1cv8/safe_storage_question/,Firearms,False

Ubongo,Can Hillary get to the top again?,"I don't know if recent events change things, but I couldn't help wondering if this gives a Hillary campaign the chance to rise from the dead?

I have nothing but respect for Hillary. Hillary's achievements were top of the world.

The fact that he has been dead for 16 years probably counts against him, but he could knock another bugger off. 

What do you think?

ripterrariumtv,What is the greatest work of fiction and why?,"In your opinion, what would you consider the best? And what criteria do you use to determine the best?

The ""best"" is subjective. So I'm curious to see what everyone's choice is and why they chose it.

Not using any criteria and going by personal preference is fine too since art is subjective and the word ""best"" can be used for personal favourite works as well.",2024-12-25 05:34:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1hlum65/what_is_the_greatest_work_of_fiction_and_why/,literature,False
Grouchy-Yam-7381,AncestryDNA - Genetic Genie Results,"Hi there,  
I did an AncestryDNA test and then uploaded my results to GeneticGenie to break down if I have any gene variations. I came back with variations in MSH2 and PMS2. See below pictures of their variations from GeneticGenie.

All say benign underneath in green so I'm assuming these variations don't cause Lynch syndrome. So my question is it only certain variations in these genes that cause Lynch Syndrome?

I knew I had Lynch Syndrome anyway with PMS2 per my genetic counsellor's report below however it says I was tested for MSH2 and nothing was found? Does that mean my AncestryDNA test is wrong?

Also the variation in PMS2 per AncestryDNA is a different variation to my genetic counsellor's report so I'm assuming the PMS2 variation in the genetic counsellor's report is the variation that causes Lynch Syndrome and not the variation per AncestryDNA.

Sorry, this is all very confusing. I've sent this to my genetic counsellor too but her office is closed for the holidays so I said I'd chance here for a quicker response. I'm just kind of freaking out because I was worried I have MSH2 also which has a higher chance of cancers.

asiabbygurl,Where to find Yoga training in Philippines ,"I've been really interested in yoga and want to complete a 200-hour training program, but I'm not sure if there's an institution that offers it around here. I've been searching for a while, and it’s a bit disheartening that we don’t have much access to pursuing hobbies like this. As a student on a tight budget, I’m planning to start learning yoga and see if I can organize something for others in my area who are also interested, either for free or at a very low cost. 

~ Do you have any recommendations where I can take my training around Manila or Quezon City Philippines?

Charming-Command7084,مشكلة خاصة,"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته ، تحية طيبة، أما بعد :
انا طالب طب اسنان، ادرس واتعب والحمدلله لكن ببعض الاحيان عندما ادخل قاعة الامتحان وابدا برؤية ورقة الامتحان يصيبني التشوش(عدم القدرة على التركيز وضبابية في الرؤية) علما انني امتلك ماء ابيض في احد العينين نتيجة اصابة في الحجرة الأمامية وارتدي النظارات عند الدراسة.

لا استطيع التركيز ابدا اكثر من نصف ساعة  و خلالها قد اسرح في سناريوهات متعددة لاحصر لها ومواضيع وهمية غير حقيقية، وهذا منذ الطفولة علما انني عانيت من التنمر المفرط بسبب اسمي الذي لم يجد العائبون لي عيبا غيره وهو ليس من اختياري أساساً(يعد اسم مختلط في بلدي وغالبية الذين لديهم هذا الاسم من الإناث) .
وخلال كتابتي لهذه الاسطر قد سرحت فيها أيضاً ونفس الشيء يحدث حتى في صلاتي.
الموضوع قد اتعبني نفسيا وانهكني واوصلني لمرحلة مابعدها مرحلة لا اجد من اشكو اليه كوني رجل ولا تجوز لي الشكوى وان شكوت ستقابل بالاستهزاء(سبق وشكيت وهذه النتيجة)
وانا والله يعلم بإمكانياتي والحمدلله كوني من الطلبة الجيدين والقابلين للتميز و كون بعض الدكاترة يحبوني ويثنون على اجتهادي المتواضع اتمنى من حضراتكم ومنمن أتم قراءة هذا البوست المساعدة عند معرفة الإجابة او الدعاء لنا ولأموتنا واموات المسلمين ",2024-12-25 10:32:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iraq/comments/1hlyep1/مشكلة_خاصة/,Iraq,False
